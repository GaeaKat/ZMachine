S141: "Talking to yourself is a sign of impending mental collapse."
S142: "You really can't start a worthwhile conversation with "
S143: " with an unmistakable lack of warmth."
S144: "What a peculiar gesture that would be."
S145: "You hug yourself for warmth.  It really is getting a little strange
here."
S146: "You give yourself a happy little squeeze."
S147: "You wrap your arms around yourself, feeling faintly chilled."
S148: "You're not feeling that affectionate."
S149: "What a peculiar gesture that would be."
S150: "What you're carrying isn't important."
S151: "Unlit, except for the single spotlight; unfurnished, except for the
defining swath of black velvet.  And a placard on a little stand."
S152: "If you want to leave, just say so."
S153: "All you can see of it is a narrow vent up under the ceiling. 
Malfunctioning, perhaps.  Makes a bit of a racket from time to time.  But it's
not important; you should try not to let things like that distract you."
S154: "If you pay close attention, you can hear a benign hum."
S155: "You can't reach to have a look at what's behind the vent plate.  But it
seems a fair guess that there is in fact nothing there."
S156: "Distant chatter reaches your ears.  "
S157: "From beyond the corner comes a trill of laughter, high and improbable. 
"
S158: "In the other room, someone drops a glass.  "
S159: "There is a distant clink of champagne glasses, a murmur of conversation.
 "
S160: "Movement beyond the corner; a pause; retreat.  "
S161: "Someone walks partway down the hall, but does not come this far.  "
S162: "Footsteps approach the corner, and you have the sense that you are about
to be interrupted; but after a moment they withdraw again.  "
S163: "A faint jingle in the distance from the Covarrubias piece.  "
S164: "Very high and clear, you hear a bell ring in the other room -- part of
the Faerie Queen installation.  "
S165: "Ticking from your watch.  "
S166: "For a moment the only sound you can hear is the ticking of your own
watch.  "
S167: "Silence.  "
S168: "In the distant chatter, a lull comes.  "
S169: "The babble of polite conversation in the other room briefly stills.  "
S170: "Your heart sounds oddly loud.  "
S171: "You mostly just hear yourself breathe.  In.  Out.  "
S172: "Someone out there has a prolific sneezing fit.  "
S173: "A hum from the air conditioner.  "
S174: "The air conditioner gives a conscious rattle.  "
S175: "Distant music, audible only for a moment...  "
S176: "You pick out a few high sax notes from the jazz band.  "
S177: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S178: "It does look invitingly fuzzy.  Fiddling with the accoutrements of an
installation is considered poor form, however."
S179: "The curtain comes all the way to the floor, leaving not even a strip of
wall visible beyond."
S180: "The curtain is firmly tacked to the wall behind it.  Having a look at
what lies on the other side would take a good bit of determination.  Not worth
dismantling it for a passing whim."
S181: "You'd have to be fairly curious to risk bringing down gallery security
on your head.  And what are the odds that there's anything at all back there? 
Really."
S182: "Not stopping to question the odd fixity of this idea, you reach out and
grasp the curtain.  Galatea gives a little gasp as you pull firmly; tiny gold
tacks fly out of the wall and roll across the polished floor.  And there's just
blank plaster, and rows of holes where the tacks went...

"
S183: "You turn and find Galatea regarding you in some amusement from the
pedestal.  "Looking for something?"

You shrug, feeling like an idiot; in the distance you hear the heavy tread of
approaching feet.  You'll never be able to explain this: a compulsion that came
from outside, totally out of character, like a command from God..."
S184: "Heavy black velvet, making her skin seem even paler and more alien by
contrast."
S185: "The curtain moves in a slight breeze.  "
S186: "The air conditioning hums, sending a ripple through the velvet curtain. 
"
S187: "In the drapery of the velvet your eye picks out a leering mouth.  You
blink.  "
S188: "The spontaneous movements of the velvet backdrop catch your attention
again: you know they're probably meaningless and random, but you can't help
wondering if they're somehow triggered to unnerve you.

"
S189: "Your eye wanders to the fraying edge of the velvet.  "
S190: "The velvet is tacked to the wall, at the edge, with a row of tiny gold
pins.  They wink at you and you resist the urge to count them.  "
S191: ""What's so fascinating about the curtain that it merits your fixed
attention?"

She laughs; turns a bit towards you; seems to relax a shade.  "Nothing," she
says, "except that it presents no surprises.""
S192: "

You raise an eyebrow.  Processing humor in an apparently spontaneous manner is
a rarity."
S193: ""So what's with the velvet curtain?" you ask.

"It's supposed to make it easier to see me," she replies.  "Apparently without
it I 'blend in with the back wall.'  And we can't have that.""
S194: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S195: "The glare blinds you momentarily.  You blink to clear your eyes of the
spots."
S196: "It's odorless, as far as you can tell from here."
S197: "It's set into the ceiling, a good ten feet above the top of your head."
S198: ""So does that get in your eyes?" you ask, gesturing at the spotlight.

"A bit.  It's also too hot."  She shrugs.  "But what can you do.""
S199: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S200: "It's hard to see it, under the sweep of the gown."
S201: "That kind of interaction with the installation would earn you a lasting
reputation for eccentricity, were you to be caught at it."
S202: "It's already occupied, and there's certainly no room for two. 
Interesting statement though that might make."
S203: "You find yourself staring into the deep-black shadow where the pedestal
meets the floor.  "
S204: "The crescent shadow of the pedestal catches your eye, so dark it almost
seems an object in itself.  "
S205: ""Do you care for this pedestal?  It seems a bit forced," you remark.

She shrugs.

"Just so you know," you say, "some of the other pieces are put right on the
floor.  In the next room there's a Komininsky--"

"
S206: ""Is this a test?" she interrupts.  "Can your intelligent mannequins not
move from their assigned places?"  "
S207: ""Pray observe."

She gathers her gown in one fist so that she can step off the pedestal.  An
awkward movement -- it's too tall a platform, and she doesn't seem accustomed
to the nuances of moving while wearing a gown.

But it is with great dignity that she walks away and rounds the corner, her
bare feet making no sound on the wooden floor."
S208: ""I've been put here," she replies firmly."
S209: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S210: "Large cream letters on a black ground.

"
S211: "47.  Galatea

White Thasos marble.  Non-commissioned work by the late Pygmalion of Cyprus. 
(The artist has since committed suicide.)

Originally not an animate.  The waking of this piece from its natural state
remains unexplained.
"
S212: "The placard stand is too skinny to conceal anything."
S213: "The idea that someone might come in and find you licking the placard
prevents you from carrying out this plan."
S214: "You very much doubt it has a discernible odor."
S215: "The lettering is very slightly raised, the edges crisp under your
fingers.  Along the bottom is a Braille transliteration, though you lack the
skill to read it."
S216: "Your eye goes to the placard, whose letters stand out preternaturally
sharp.  "
S217: "You notice the curious shadow of the placard stand -- like an arrow
pointing the way back to the main gallery.  "
S218: "You don't have the heart to say anything more about it."
S219: ""So what if the placard's a trick?" you say. "Pygmalion might actually
be alive and well, and the whole point of this is for me to tell you and garner
a reaction."

"
S220: ""Do you think the placard might be lying?" you ask.  "I mean, is there a
reason why--"

She shakes her head.  "No reason that makes sense.  Not about something so
important.  So that's why they wouldn't let me see it.  They would have known
that I wouldn't agree to stand here if I knew...""
S221: ""So," you ask cautiously.  "Is this placard all true?"

"I haven't read it," she says.  "The gallery owners didn't put it up until I
was already up here.  And you may have noticed that I can't exactly see it from
this position."

"
S222: "Her forehead wrinkles in consternation.  "
S223: ""Or...  I suppose they ordinarily have instructions, those placards. 
For how to interact with the piece.  Am I right?  That would explain why I
wasn't allowed to see it.  Except--"

"
S224: ""Except that that doesn't apply to you," you supply.  "Don't worry.  I
think I know why you weren't shown it.  It might make you uncomfortable to be
written up that way.""
S225: "You chuckle as she stumbles over her own logic.

"Don't think about it," you say quickly, hoping to prevent one of the paradox
loops that these pieces sometimes fall into.  It's always such a bore to run
into a bug.  You could probably get her restarted yourself, without having to
bother the owners, but then there'd be all sorts of lost ground to recover..."
S226: "When you say nothing, she raises one shoulder in an elegant, dismissive
shrug."
S227: ""I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't be true, though," she
remarks."
S228: "Not much else to say on that score."
S229: ""Tell me what the placard says," you say.

"I can't read it from here," she remarks dryly.  "And you know, I'm not allowed
to get down.""
S230: "You don't have anything to say on the matter.
"
S231: "She knows of the artist's death.  To belabor it would be the height of
cruelty.
"
S232: "A bit of an enigma, really.  A complex piece "
S233: "-- albeit one with limitations -- "
S234: "by someone you've never heard of.  Which suggests a pseudonym or perhaps
a hoax, except of course that she doesn't remind you of the work of anyone in
particular.  "
S235: "The skin hints at VanItallie of several years ago.  "
S236: "The story focusing reminds you of "Victim."  "
S237: "There are superficial resemblances here and there.  On the whole,
though, she's unique."
S238: "You'd have a hard time thinking about anything else.  She's prickly, but
also embarrassingly open; "
S239: "not exactly easy to read.  And she also makes you edgy in some strange
ways.  "
S240: "How often do you mention your sister -- to anyone?"
S241: "How often do you talk about your parents?"
S242: "The way she reacted to being touched, for instance.  (When was the last
time you deliberately touched a real person?  No, don't go there...)"
S243: "You're not sure what to think. She looks like an animate -- mostly; she
acts like one -- sometimes; she's in an animate exhiit in one of the best
reputed galleries in the country. She's also an advanced piece, if she's a
piece at all, by an artist (one artist, not a workshop or team) of whom you
have never heard before.  And you've heard of everyone."
S244: "You don't really have a full sense of her as a work yet -- either in the
sense of assessing technical particulars (body mechanics, range of topics,
vocabulary recognition, mood simulation and authenticity; setting, lighting,
props and sound effects...) or the artist's overall intent for the piece (what
mood he meant to evoke, what issues he intended to raise.)  There's a certain
assurance in her bearing that convinces you that he must have meant SOMETHING. 
But there's also an unusual openendedness to the piece, like there are lot of
ways you can take this but you don't even know what they all are.."
S245: "She is facing away from you.  You cannot see her face, only her hair,
and the line of her shoulder.  It's hard to know what she's looking at -- the
velvet backdrop, if she has her eyes open, but there's not much to see in that.
 Mostly, it is obvious, she is "
S246: "not"
S247: " looking at you.

Her green dress widens out at the knee, falling over the pedestal on which she
stands in a way that would probably be very awkward, if she wanted to move."
S248: "Though she has her back to you, her head is turned somewhat, offering
half a view of cheek and ear.  "
S249: "Her body may be turned towards you, but she still won't look at you. 
Her gaze is fixed somewhere on the blank wall.  

Her patrician nose, the slight compression of the mouth, the line of slender
throat and chin, show sharp and cold against the velvet drapery."
S250: "Her face is in three-quarter view now; the effect is softer than you
would have expected.  There is a shyness in the mouth that reminds you of a
Botticelli virgin, bashful in the gaze of Gabriel.  But the eyes are lidded and
oblique."
S251: "Her eyes glitter strangely in the downshot light."
S252: "Her eyes shine a smoky green -- a color almost alien, until she meets
your look, and smiles."
S253: "Very quietly.  "
S254: "There's no color in her voice at all.  "
S255: "Almost playfully.  "
S256: "There's a suppressed mirth in her voice.  "
S257: "Her voice is hard.  "
S258: "Her voice snaps like breaking crystal.  "
S259: "(Strange, almost inhuman, the vocals on this piece.)  "
S260: "She sounds as you imagine the stone might sound, if it could speak.  "
S261: "Her voice is dry, almost gritty.  "
S262: "Her voice doesn't sound like it's coming from a human throat at all.  "
S263: "Her voice is naturally low -- alto tones -- but there's something wrong
with the modulation, as though at any moment she might start to scream.  "
S264: "Still that low voice.  "
S265: "A pause.  "
S266: "She ducks her head.  "
S267: "Her head moves -- as though she were going to turn and look at you
properly -- but then she thinks better of it.  "
S268: "She closes her eyes a moment.  "
S269: "Her eyes drift closed for just a moment, before she seems to recall
herself.  "
S270: "Her eyes narrow.  "
S271: "There's an ugly hardness about her eyes.  "
S272: "Her eyes flicker, but she doesn't look over.  "
S273: "She blinks once without turning toward you.  "
S274: "She shoots you a look that verges on the playful.  "
S275: "Her eyes meet yours, large and dark.  "
S276: "She meets your eyes for a dark moment.  "
S277: "She glances at you and then looks away.  "
S278: "You glance up and your eyes meet.  There's a dull prickle at the base of
your skull.  "
S279: "You find yourself staring at the dull sheen of her gown.  "
S280: "You become aware of her breathing -- the slight expansion of her ribs,
the soft exhalation -- natural, and yet somehow studied.  "
S281: "She runs one finger along the fabric of her dress.  "
S282: "She shifts her weight on the pedestal.  "
S283: "She mutters a few words under her breath; you can't hear them, but you
sense that it was a half-hearted effort at best."
S284: ""Why don't you try praying?" you ask.

"Does it work for you?" she asks sharply.  No.  No, it didn't work for you. 
She has a point there."
S285: ""Not a suggestion that makes terribly much sense," she replies."
S286: "She mutters a few words under her breath; you can't hear them, but you
sense that it was a half-hearted effort at best."
S287: "But she doesn't.  Her face keeps that still look, as though she's
concentrating on something inside her own head."
S288: ""Galatea.  Look at me."

But she doesn't.  Her head stays at the same angle, her whole body tense and
still."
S289: ""Have a look at this pedestal," you say.  "This is ridiculous.  No one
displays on these things any more.  It enforces an undesirable distance between
object and viewer.  You should be standing on the floor; if possible you should
seem no different from me..."

"
S290: ""I'm not being displayed as one of your AI constructs," she cuts in
sharply.  "I'm being displayed as a statue.  Who happens to be alive, yes.  But
a statue, nonetheless.""
S291: ""I would hardly be interesting if I seemed just like you," she replies. 
"As soon as you forget where I come from, that I began as a statue, I lose my
status as work of art.""
S292: "You direct her attention to the pedestal, but she doesn't seem to
understand what you consider interesting about it.  Indeed, it is pretty
ordinary."
S293: "She glances up for a moment, then turns back to her previous pose.  "I
see nothing very interesting about it, I confess.""
S294: "She glances up, stares unblinking a moment into the light, turns back to
look at you.  (Her pupils haven't even contracted -- they're still wide and
dark.)  "Not very interesting," she remarks."
S295: "She already is facing the curtain."
S296: ""Galatea, look at the curtain."

"I've already seen enough of it for one evening, thanks," she replies curtly."
S297: "You've already told her what it says; that is probably enough.  Possibly
more than enough."
S298: ""Galatea, have a look at this placard," you say.

"I can't see it from here," she replies.  "Why?  Does it say something
interesting?"

(Something in her diffidence makes you wonder: can she even read?)"
S299: "She's presumably already more familiar with that than you are."
S300: "She gives it a cursory glance, then turns back to her original position.
 If you hoped to indicate something to her, you clearly failed."
S301: ""Don't like me facing you, now?" she asks wryly.  But she doesn't move."
S302: ""Would you turn a bit?" you ask.

"
S303: ""Would you turn a bit?" you ask.

"I'll do as I like.""
S304: ""I think constantly," she says; "it's the one thing I have always known
how to do.  Not necessarily anything deep by your standards, but I started out
with less information, remember.""
S305: ""I am listening."  In a lower voice: "I always listen.""
S306: ""I don't see what good vandalism would do," she remarks."
S307: "She looks at you as though you're off your rocker -- and possibly she
has a point."
S308: "There's no aid she can give you.  Whether the reverse is true is another
question."
S309: "You've already asked once.  More would constitute harrassment."
S310: "The dress probably doesn't come off.  Or if it does, it reveals access
panels and switches.  It's really best not to mess much with things that the
artist meant as scenery."
S311: "Her expression is pure disdain.  "Is that what you think I am?  A toy?"

"
S312: "Her eyes meet yours, a swift flicker of darkness.  She puts a hand on
your shoulder for support, leans down--

"
S313: "After a moment you disentangle your fingers from her hair.  "Come on,"
you say.  "There are things we should talk about, and this is not the place.""
S314: "That suggestion doesn't go over too well, given her current mood."
S315: "Either she doesn't hear this suggestion, or she deems it unworthy of
response."
S316: "She's standing in front of a dark curtain.  The contrast with her skin
is quite striking."
S317: "Difficult, considering the arrangement of her gown."
S318: "Even if she were a manageable size, it would obviously be impossible to
smuggle such a valuable piece out of the gallery.  The sensors at the door
would go off, even if (somehow) no one else noticed.  Not to mention the
trouble of trying to fence a unique and identifiable work.

Of course, you could just keep her in your living room.  As a conversation
piece."
S319: "Trying to force her to come along with you is unlikely to work.  For one
thing, for all her slenderness she looks reasonably strong.  For another, the
gallery is full of people who would doubtless react if she started making a lot
of noise."
S320: "She's too tall and too strong for you to manhandle.  If you want her to
come along with you, you'll have to use a subtler tactic."
S321: "You take her by the elbow and turn her a few degrees towards yourself. 
"
S322: "Too quickly for you to react, she catches your wrist with her other
hand, holding it so tightly that you fear for the bones.

"
S323: ""I told you," she says (slow, gravelly voice), "not to do that again."

Heat floods you.  She shouldn't be able to do that, shouldn't touch the
audience without permission, certainly shouldn't inflict pain or injury. 
Broken.

Spluttering, you speak an old reset code -- EUDOXIA -- but she doesn't respond.
 Other than with a positively ghoulish smile.

"
S324: "It's going to take a couple of shots of something strong to keep
nightmares out of your head tonight."
S325: "This time she doesn't say anything at all.  But she's plainly furious."
S326: "She cooperates, but her arm feels stiff under your touch.  "Don't do
that again, please," she says."
S327: "You take another breath, salt and tang."
S328: "You would have expected something feminine -- flowers probably, or some
low predatory scent -- but she smells like brine and the cold ocean."
S329: "There's almost always a very unpleasant taste to animate skin.  Kind of
oily and putrescent.  One or two experiences have taught you better than to
experiment."
S330: "Some things are best left to the imagination."
S331: "You stare fixedly at a point on her shoulder."
S332: "She looks conscious, a little uncomfortable."
S333: "After what she said earlier about people staring at her, this goes over
especially poorly.  The color rises in her cheeks and her mouth tightens, but
she doesn't otherwise move."
S334: "She doesn't seem to appreciate your steady stare."
S335: "That seems already to have been accomplished.  For good or ill."
S336: ""What are you really?" you demand, troubled by the memory of the
shifting of her shape, the qualities of stone that come and go at her will.

"
S337: ""Tell me about yourself," you prompt.

"There's nothing to tell," she says. "I'm lost without him; everything that I
am comes from his stories and his precepts.""
S338: ""Tell me about yourself," you prompt.

"If I'm some sort of machine, you know more about it than I do.""
S339: ""Read the placard," she says.  "That's what it's there for, after all."
"
S340: ""You've read the placard, so you know what "
S341: "they"
S342: " think is important... I'm not sure how much there is to add.  I was
carved.  I woke up.  And here I am.""
S343: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S344: "her"
S345: "You can't reach with her standing the way she is."
S346: "You feel too self-conscious to do that; she might not appreciate the
gesture."
S347: "You hardly dare, considering her remarks on the subject.  "
S348: "Some of these pieces will shut down of their own accord if you're too
impertinent."
S349: "It's probably not worth making her any angrier."
S350: "How would it look if someone came around the corner and found you --
well.  There's a certain decorum to be preserved."
S351: "That's not even in view at this angle."
S352: "You lack the expertise to disassemble an animate with your bare hands,
even if that kind of behavior were encouraged.  "
S353: "It's unlikely she'd respond well to such rough handling."
S354: "Tell her what?  There's nothing to say on the matter.
"
S355: "Her skin is smooth and warm, though it lacks the velvety finish of a
Hazar; no flaws, no hair, and the musculature underneath is fairly soft."
S356: "That area is pretty thoroughly covered by the gown."
S357: "That area is pretty thorougly covered by the gown."
S358: "They are shell-like and translucent in the spotlight, a gleaming pure
white."
S359: "You trace the edge of one ear.  The shape is remarkably accurate, but
the texture is wrong; what ought to be velvet is waxy, stiff, and cold.  She
holds herself very still."
S360: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S361: "They're a deep grey-green, and the pupils are unnaturally large and
dark, despite the downglare of the spotlight."
S362: "They are some strange color between green and grey-brown, like a forest
hidden by smoke."
S363: "They are shadowed, unreadable from this angle."
S364: "You can't see them with her face averted."
S365: "Even if she would let you, the thought is disgusting."
S366: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S367: ""What was it like, having your eyes carved?" you ask.

""
S368: " drilled at the corners," she says.  "And that was agony -- waiting to
see whether he would go too deep.  He never did, but there was always doubt.""
S369: "A proud, aristocratic nose, without softness; almost aquiline."
S370: "You trace the slope of her nose with one finger, admiring the fineness
of the workmanship."
S371: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S372: "You can't see her mouth with her head averted."
S373: "The expression of her mouth is hard to read; it seems to hold something
back, from pride or from shyness."
S374: "Compressed lips, faint lines at the corners -- it's not a flattering
look for her, given that her mouth is already a little too thin-lipped and pale
under other circumstances."
S375: "The edges are just slightly turned down."
S376: "The expression could best be described as maliciously satisfied."
S377: "There is something smug about the set of her lips."
S378: "There is the beginning of a smile at the corners."
S379: "You touch her bottom lip with your thumb--

"
S380: "They're very fine, unpainted, like porcelain.  When they fall over her
eyes, you can see the movement of the iris beneath -- a sign of their
translucency and flexibility."
S381: "That's typically an especially delicate part of the mechanism -- better
not to touch.  You might damage her, and that would be embarrassing -- not to
mention expensive."
S382: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S383: "Her eyebrows are slim and dark: unusual for someone of her coloration,
but then, nothing about her looks is ordinary."
S384: "You trace the arch of her eyebrows: the shape is pleasing, even though
there is something not quite right about the texture of the hair.  A little too
stiff."
S385: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S386: "You trace the curve of her cheek gently with the back of one finger-- "
S387: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S388: "She's turned away; you can't see it."
S389: "It makes a clean, continuous line with her neck; she reminds you of a
wetlands bird, preparing for flight."
S390: "You take her chin in your hand, as you might if she were a wayward child
who refused to meet your eye.  But she jerks away impatiently, breath quick. 
"Don't "
S391: "do"
S392: "You run a finger along the underside of her jaw--"
S393: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S394: "A fine architecture of chin and cheekbone, brow and nose.  If there is
vulnerability, or the hint of a flaw, it lingers in her mouth and at the edges
of her eyes.

"
S395: "She seems to be in a relatively good mood.  Eyes wider and less tense. 
Hint of a smile."
S396: "Her chin is tight, her mouth set in a line.  If she would meet your eye,
you're sure you would see the full depth of her wrath.

Your sister used to look the same way when she was pissed off -- at the age of
about thirteen."
S397: "Hard to know what to make of the expression.  It's terrifyingly bland,
no tension anywhere except for the slight curl of the mouth -- which might be a
smile, or might be raw contempt."
S398: "She looks a bit blank, as though caught up in some internal thought; her
focus doesn't seem to be on you."
S399: "The mass of her hair conceals it."
S400: "Her neck is so slender that it barely avoids being grotesque, very
white, and without banding.  When she moves her head, there is only the most
impressionistic suggestion of the working of realistic musculature."
S401: "She puts one hand to the base of her neck, tracing the dip of the
collarbone.  "
S402: "She swallows.  "
S403: "She clears her throat.  "
S404: "You can't reach from here, what with her being up on the pedestal."
S405: "Her head is just a tiny bit small for a real person; not grotesquely so,
but enough that someone with an eye for proportion and anatomy will notice.  It
gives her an unnatural air of fragility and makes her seem even taller and more
slender than she is."
S406: "Her head feels solid and compact, the skull round and without bumps."
S407: "They are indeed bare, but they show no flaws; nothing to be
self-conscious about."
S408: "Left bare by the gown, wrongly perfect."
S409: "You put a hand on her shoulder: the skin is smooth and warm, though it
lacks the velvety finish of a vintage Hazar."
S410: ""I mind--"  She pauses, shakes her head.  "I don't have the words to
explain what I mean.  Something about the way people look at me; and the sense
that I'm supposed to want them to look.""
S411: "Bare to just below her shoulder blades, with the hint of a spine beneath
the flesh."
S412: "You put a hand on her back, between the shoulderblades, to feel her
breath rising and falling, and the faint motion of implied muscle.

When you take the hand away, however, she shivers.  "
S413: "You run a finger along her spine, from the nape of her neck to the place
where her dress begins, noting with approval the distinct vertebrae under the
skin.

But when you draw your hand away she shivers.  "
S414: "her"
S415: "Smooth, pale, and with a sheen, as though polished."
S416: ""It took a lot of polishing.  Hours on a spot no broader than my
shoulder blade.  But otherwise it would have been all ridged." "
S417: "Her arms are bare and ungloved.  In the sharp downward light, you can
see that they are completely smooth and hairless.  There are no veins in the
hollow of her wrist, or any discoloration at all, except for what looks like a
small mole next to the elbow."
S418: "She presses her arm more closely against her side.  "
S419: "She moves her arm -- just a slight movement, it comes into an
unexpectedly graceful position.  Art, not nature.  If you'd been about to
forget that she began as a statue.  "
S420: "Though she is hardly fat, there are soft dimples at the elbows, finely
carved."
S421: "Hollow and vulnerable, but without the visible veins that you would
expect of someone with such translucent skin."
S422: "You can see, now, how artificial it is, with its perfectly circular
border and the tiny indentation in the top surface where a pointer might have
gone."
S423: "A little raised mole, the only dark mark on her."
S424: "You'd rather not repeat the experience."
S425: "It's cold and rough, as though a pebble had grown into her skin, and
there's a very tiny depression in the center of it.  You draw away, embarrassed
and ill with the sense of not-rightness."
S426: "She moves her hand protectively to cover it.  "Yes," she says, ""
S427: " left that to show that I wasn't completely finished.  It was one of the
puntella, the reference spots for the pointing machine -- he made a model of me
in plaster, and then he used this machine to scale up the design.""
S428: "Slender, with delicately modelled ligaments on the underside. "
S429: "She rubs one wrist with the opposite thumb.  "
S430: "She follows your glance, lifting one hand and spreading the fingers to
show you the delicate modeling."
S431: "She has slender hands with tapering fingers.  "
S432: "At the moment, they are formed into fists -- a gesture she is probably
unaware of."
S433: "At the moment, they hang loosely at her sides, sometimes hiding
themselves for a moment in the folds of her gown."
S434: "It's the kind of gesture that's charming the first time and then
progressively more creepy and bizarre afterwards.  So you'll leave matters as
they stand."
S435: "The impulse startles you: that's not the kind of gesture you're usually
tempted to make."
S436: "Her hand rests lightly in yours for a moment; then she withdraws it."
S437: "Her fingers interleave themselves with yours.  You look at your joined
hands: your skin looks darker than usual, in the contrast.  And it is the
reminder of the disparity in your experiences that makes you draw away again."
S438: "You touch the fine skin on the back of her hand, and marvel at the
shifting of bones beneath."
S439: "You kiss her hand, very much in the grand manner.  She thaws
perceptibly."
S440: ""Your hands seem very delicately made."

"
S441: ""All the separations were done with a drill, yes," she says.  "And then
smoothed -- but if "
S442: " had just tried to carve them directly with the chisel, the marble might
have fractured.  He did explain that much to me."

She holds up one hand and flexes the fingers experimentally.  "The movement,"
she adds with a twist of humor, "was "
S443: "not"
S444: " courtesy of his work.  And I must say that I'm glad I didn't have to
endure the individual manufacture of muscle and bone -- or whatever it is that
I have in place of it.""
S445: "She blows a strand of hair out of her face.  "
S446: "She pushes a strand of hair out of her face.  "
S447: "It is fine as an infant's, but resistant, too, and slightly stiff."
S448: "It is a pale, Scandinavian blonde, curling just a little beside her
face, but elsewhere straight and quite severe."
S449: "She touches the end of one strand self-consciously, as though surprised
to find it there; then shrugs.  "It is just like anyone else's," she says.  "I
have to wash it every day, and brush it, and that, I can tell you, is not much
fun.  It's very fine -- see" -- and she loops a bit around her finger, and lets
it go -- "and it ties itself in knots when I'm asleep.""
S450: "She's austerely proportioned -- like Audrey Hepburn, perhaps."
S451: "If you knew designers, you might recognize it: it looks expensive.  A
shimmering column from the bodice down to the knee, where it flares to cover
the whole base of the pedestal."
S452: "Your native sense of propriety prevents you."
S453: "Most animates aren't complete under their clothes.  Better to leave it
on."
S454: "Your native sense of propriety prevents you."
S455: "The fabric shifts, smooth and shining, under your hand.  But then the
warmth of her body reaches you through it, and you draw away instinctively as
though scalded."
S456: "She shrugs in it.  "It looks odd, doesn't it?" she says.  "I insisted on
clothes, and they bought me "
S457: "this"
S458: ""I've told you all I know about it," "
S459: "
No doubt.  You suppress a weary sigh."
S460: "
You feel a twinge of disappointment.  Other things about this piece are so
promising: the meticulous attention to detail on the body, the delicacy of the
facial expressions, the variability of mood.  There are those who would call
that inconsistency, or lack of a coherent artistic vision; but you've seen too
many pieces stereotypes made animate. The hint of instability--

But no piece is going to get a serious critical reception with such a pathetic
database.  And that's that."
S461: ""What about you?" you ask.  "Was he in love with you?"

"
S462: ".  "He only found me tolerable at all as long as he could view me as an
extension of himself.  And the damnable thing is that I found that preferable
to being cast out into the cold.  I'd go back right now, if I could."

"
S463: ""That's no way to live," you remark.

"Neither is this.  No friends, no family, no plans and no experience of life. 
I'm dependent even for my clothing on people I don't like.""
S464: ""Why don't you take off that dress?" you suggest (in what you hope is a
casual tone of voice.)

"
S465: ""I don't need a personal demonstration of anything we're discussing,
thanks.""
S466: ""There aren't any cogs and wheels visible underneath, if that's what
you're curious about," she retorts."
S467: ""What a suavely phrased request.  Tell me, does it usually work?" 
There's a chuckle in her voice, and you flinch.

"
S468: "Unexpectedly she takes pity on you.  "You don't have to answer that,"
she says.  "It was a bit venomous, but you took me by surprise.  It wasn't at
all the kind of thing I would expect you to say."

"It's not.  The kind of thing I would normally say.  I don't know what's wrong
with me."
S469: ""  (Other than an ill-timed sense of mischief and some good
old-fashioned lust, that is.)"
S470: "  Other than an ill-timed sense of mischief, maybe."

"I see.  And you have a good enough sense of me by now to know that I won't
embarrass you by actually complying with such a request."

"Something like that."

"
S471: "She puts a hand on your shoulder, leans down, and whispers in your ear:
"It's sewn on.  But if you know of someplace quiet where there's a pair of
scissors..."

Which just goes to show, you never can tell."
S472: "

Funny the way you find yourself treating her as though she were a real person. 
It's always wise, of course, to try and treat animates as though you thought
the illusion worked -- an audience that plays along is as important as anything
the artist puts into his work -- but this is more of a gut response."
S473: "But when you try to catch her eye, you fail.  There's a faint flush in
her cheeks.

"Forget I said that," you say.""
S474: "

That settles it.  No animate gets convincingly "
S475: "embarrassed"
S476: "Apparently you fail.  "Well," she says, "that was crass.  Obviously you
realize that I'm not going to do any such thing, so why did you bother to ask? 
Just trying to rile me?"

You shrug, not really certain what motivated you to ask that particular
question at this particular moment -- the intriguing way the light fell on her
skin?  Well, who knows...

"
S477: "Whatever the answer, it doesn't matter now.  She gathers her gown in one
hand and descends from the pedestal, striding past you with the disdainful
reserve of a goddess.

You watch her depart with the rueful reflection that you did, at least, get to
see a little leg."
S478: ""I told you," she says.  "I'm not really comfortable appearing without
it.  If that ruins the way I was intended to appear, that's just too bad.""
S479: ""Because I don't want to."

Not much you can say to that."
S480: ""You don't believe me when I tell you you're a machine, but here, I'll
prove it to you," you say reasonably.  "You have certain constraints that you
can't go against.  You can't harm a living person, for instance."

"
S481: ""What are you telling me to do?"

"Just try and hurt me."

"
S482: "You stand there smiling at her, and she sighs.  "You're right, I can't
do it.  From where I stand it feels as though I simply have an objection to
violence.  Is that what it feels like, being a machine?  Is your code
disguised, from your point of view, as moral scruple?"

"How would I know?" you retort.

She tilts her head in acknowledgement.  "My point exactly.  Maybe we're both
machines; maybe neither of us is; maybe this whole thing is itself a simulation
inside a box somewhere."

"
S483: ""An unanswerable bit of Sophistry," you reply.  "You win.  For now." 
You execute a little bow, and she laughs as you go out."
S484: ""Galatea--" you begin, and then stop.  It suddenly seems a bad idea to
give her an instruction like that.  She might carry through, after all, and
then where would you be?  She looks strong enough, for all her slenderness, to
do you some serious damage..."
S485: ""You don't believe me when I tell you you're a machine, but here, I'll
prove it to you," you say reasonably.  "You have certain constraints that you
can't go against.  You can't destroy yourself, for instance."

"
S486: ""What are you telling me to do?"

"Try and inflict damage on yourself.  Just try it."

"
S487: "  "Why the hell would I want to do that?  If I fail, I prove a point
that I don't at all want proven, and if I succeed, I'm dead.  A lose-lose
proposition, I'm sure you'll agree."  She looks at you strangely.  "For that
matter, I don't quite understand your zeal on this point.  If you're convinced
I'm a machine, what does it matter whether I agree or not?  Even supposing that
it is possible for an animate to 'agree' meaningfully to any proposition."

"
S488: "She does have a point there.  But something about this work is getting
under your skin, making you impatient, tempting you to test the boundaries of
what an animate could or should do.  Usually you go in open-minded, trying to
see the good points; this piece you find yourself wanting to break.  You want
to see the seams.

Maybe it's time to get some air."
S489: "You're not the type to say something like that to someone who is
obviously distraught."
S490: "It seems unlikely that that kind of instruction would go over well."
S491: "No need.  If she gets too difficult, you can always have her reset."
S492: "She just shakes her head.  "I don't know what you're apologizing for.""
S493: "You apologize -- again; perhaps it would be simpler if you just kept
closer guard on what you do and say in the first place.  She is silent in so
pointed a way that you find yourself rambling.  Finally she cuts you off with a
gesture of her hand.  Enough."
S494: "You stammer out some awkward words of apology -- you've never been much
good at that sort of thing.

"
S495: ""Well.  I suppose I'll be going," you say.

"
S496: "She jerks her head brusquely; it seems she doesn't consider your
departure much of a loss."
S497: "You give her a quick, concerned glance, but she isn't looking at you.

Oh well.  She'll be fine."
S498: "You reflect as you round the corner that you're probably the last person
who will bother saying goodbye to her tonight."
S499: "So hard to know what to make of her."
S500: "You head out, feeling a little guilty.  To do a responsible assessment
of a piece, you should spend more time interacting with it."
S501: "  It occurs to you that you never so much as touched her -- you, who
have something of a reputation for your attention to tactile detail."
S502: "  The nuance is all in the detail."
S503: "

On the other hand, you already have more than enough to say about the exhibit
as a whole."
S504: "You head out, your mind marshalling points for your review.  "
S505: "The sheen of the skin is offputting -- you never so much as touched her,
and that's something that you usually make it a point to do.  "
S506: "That strange mole.  An uncanny touch.  "
S507: "The variability of her moods and expressions.  "
S508: "(Perhaps you should go back and have her reset, take another approach to
the work entirely.  There must be something there you missed.)"
S509: "And of course the conceit of the central concept: a work that both is
and is not aware of its status as art.  Which allows the piece to be commentary
on its genre, and a serious contribution to that genre, at one and the same
time."
S510: "Talking to her is too easy.  One thing tumbles out after another --
memories, philosophies, names you haven't spoken for years.

She sits down on the pedestal, drawing her knees up to her chest.  ("Have you
no respect for that gorgeous dress?" "None.") Her bare feet poke out; she's
painted the toenails a ruddy shade of bronze, and she studies the effect
whenever she isn't looking at you.

Eventually she begins to talk too: about her first encounter with a northern
rain; the frustration of trying to watch the television in her hotel room...

"
S511: "So when the gallery owners come to make sure everyone has gone home,
that is how they find you: you in your shirtsleeves -- your jacket having been
long since tossed over the placard stand -- and her with her head on your
shoulder, her gown bunched and crumpled around her.  Conscious of their ironic
regard, you leave her with your number (scribbled on a cocktail napkin) and
instructions on how to dial a telephone.

The faint clean scent of the ocean lingers all the way home."
S512: "And that's where you find yourselves when the lights blink and the
owners come to send everyone home: sitting shoulder to shoulder, shading your
eyes from that hard downglare.  You stand; a happy exhaustion sets in, so
you're too tired to be self-conscious about hugging her goodbye under the
skeptical gaze of the caterers."
S513: "She shrugs.  "Is there some particular aspect that you're interested in?
 Because you've already heard my basic take on the subject.""
S514: ""I don't know what else you want to know.  Maybe if you were more
specific...?""
S515: ""Hey," you say.  "Trade you places."

"
S516: ""What?" she asks, startled.

"Come on, get down.  You can wander around.  Talk to people.  Look at things."
S517: "  Try some of the food.  (You really should, you know.)"
S518: ""

She just looks at you speculatively, her forehead creased.

"
S519: ""Very well," she says finally.  She steps down, and you climb up in her
place -- first hanging your jacket strategically over the placard.

Which is how it comes about that you spend the rest of the night sitting on the
pedestal.  It's rather amusing, in fact; your long familiarity with animate
behavior styles makes it easy to emulate one.

Of course you are a bit piqued by your reviews: "Supplied only with esoteric
data... personable in a self-deprecating way, but unexciting... breaking no
important barriers in the development of more human-like animates."  Damn
critics.

"
S520: "From the same source, you read that the gallery hired a new assistant. 
In the photo she's looking severely at the camera, her pure-blonde hair taken
up in a French twist."
S521: "and jerk your hand away.  What you'd meant as an assessing gesture
(realism in every particular, that's the goal; a good critic thinks about skin
texture and warmth, dammit.  You're doing your "
S522: "job"
S523: ") suddenly feels like something else.

Perhaps because she's looking at you, her eyes unnaturally wide.  Your eyes
meet, and she lets go a slow breath."
S524: "

"Yes," you say softly.  "That's what I thought."  Whatever she is, she's no
animate.

She says nothing, but you suspect that she heard you clearly enough."
S525: "All you can think is: animates don't "
S526: "do"
S527: " that.  There's a conventional limit to their interactivity.  They're
meant to be touched -- but not to react--"
S528: "She doesn't bother to answer, just shakes her head impatiently."
S529: "Her hand clenches in the fabric of her gown.  "
S530: ""Is this part of a test?" she asks.  "Are you trying to determine
whether I've been well programmed?  Get this: I don't have anything more to say
on the subject.  As I believe I mentioned.""
S531: "

"Sorry," you mutter hastily.  "That wasn't the point -- I just forgot I'd
already asked you about that."

"I hope you aren't so rude to people you think are real," she replies coldly."
S532: "

You nod, suppressing your smile.  The imperious style can be very effective --
you've seen less seasoned critics cowed into discontinuing a difficult line of
questioning by such a touch."
S533: "

"Sorry," you say, reacting automatically to the venom in her voice."
S534: ""You keep asking me things when I've told you I don't "
S535: "know"
S536: " any more.  Why is it so hard for you to understand?  My life experience
is limited.  It's not that I'm trying to hide some great wonderful truth on the
subject.""
S537: "Where would you begin?  And what context would she have for anything you
could say?  "
S538: "She"
S539: " has had no childhood, no history, no network of passions and friends."
S540: "The persistent inclination to tell her such things takes you by
surprise.  Animates are notoriously poor at processing uncontextualized
personal information.  And you know better than to waste your time.

But this piece of logic doesn't banish the desire to confide in her."
S541: "She turns to face you, in a rustle of resettling skirts.  "
S542: "She turns so that she is looking at you straight on -- level gaze, smoky
eyes, brows pale and washed out in the light.  Not her most beautiful angle,
which might be why she avoids it.  "
S543: "She turns -- not her whole body, just her head, so that you can see one
ear behind the cascade of hair.  "
S544: "She shifts, so that she is now standing in profile to you, facing the
blank wall.  "
S545: "There's a wiry tension in the set of her shoulders.

"
S546: "She turns again, almost fully towards you, though she can't seem to
actually look at you: her face is still turned toward the side.  "
S547: "Her head lifts; her green gaze holds you half a moment.  "
S548: "You've already launched into the conversation without that nicety -- it
would be a little hard to go back now."
S549: "A little late for that, don't you think?"
S550: ""Hello," you say -- and stop.  What would you say next?  'I'm a famous
critic, be on your best behavior'?  There's no etiquette established; and then
it strikes you as strange that you should bother to be concerned.

Fortunately, the little awkwardness is lost on her.  "Good of you not to walk
away again," she replies.  "
S551: "No.  Whatever doubts you may have had, you're more sure than ever that
she's only a piece of machinery.  And neither your professional nor your
personal life would benefit from a blurring of boundaries."
S552: "You know better than that.  Naturally.  But the fact that it crossed
your mind surprises you a bit.  You have never had any trouble keeping it clear
in your mind when you're dealing with a piece of machinery rather than a
person."
S553: "It's a bit awkward at this angle -- the best you can manage is to put
your arm around her at the waist.  "
S554: "She relaxes, smiling wanly.  "Thanks.""
S555: "She doesn't seem to appreciate the gesture -- though she doesn't react
particularly strongly, either."
S556: "She feels a bit stiff; you're not sure she even understands the gesture,
and you break it off, suddenly impatient with yourself."
S557: "She seems stiff at first; then she relaxes into the half-embrace.  Her
hand settles on top of your head, not having any other place to go, and she
tugs gently at the hair.

You let her go, and find that she's frowning at you.  "Your hair is softer than
mine," she says."
S558: "With a sigh, she steps off the pedestal entirely and into your arms.

No one has ever hugged her before.  The certainty makes you want to weep for
her.  You hold her longer than you should; longer than is honest, considering
the ambivalence of your feelings toward her.

"Come on."  You disengage at last, but only enough to lead her.  She comes with
you, still leaning on your shoulder.

You may not be able to mend the world for her -- in fact, you may end by
hurting her quite desperately, by failing to be what she needs.  But you also
can't leave her standing there forever.  

Her gown hushes on the pale floor as you turn the corner, back to the main
gallery.  Sometimes there's no right way to do what needs to be done."
S559: "No.  Whatever doubts you may have had, you're more sure than ever that
she's only a piece of machinery.  And neither your professional nor your
personal life would benefit from a blurring of boundaries."
S560: "And how would that be better than attacking her?  What's wrong with you
tonight -- or what's wrong with her (if "wrong" is the word) -- that you're
losing your sense of reality?

Perhaps you should consider going."
S561: "You know better than that.  Naturally.  But the fact that it crossed
your mind surprises you.  You have never had any trouble keeping it clear in
your mind when you're dealing with a piece of machinery rather than a person.

"
S562: "Looked at objectively, she has nothing on Philippe Quirin's Joan of Arc,
or anything by Hazar.  If she's beautiful, she's beautiful in a distinctly
creepy way, and you only become more aware of that as you look at her.

No.  It's that she doesn't entirely seem like a machine.  And all your
calculations are off."
S563: "You can't really reach at this angle, and she seems disinclined to
cooperate."
S564: "Matters haven't quite progressed to that stage.  If indeed they are
going there at all."
S565: "Her eyes meet yours; she seems to read what you're thinking, because she
bends down, putting a hand on your shoulder to steady herself.

"
S566: "... When she pulls away, her eyes meet yours with unexpected candor. 
She looks more human than she has all evening.

"Come on."  You give a little tug, and she steps down from the pedestal. 
"There are things we should discuss, and this is not the place.""
S567: "No.  You chase the thought away before it can fully form itself."
S568: "You don't, of course.  But the impulse takes you off guard.

"
S569: "You've never had the urge to attack a piece, no matter how sarcastic, or
petulant, or crude.  You've seen other people lose it, yes -- but you're proof
against that sort of thing."
S570: "You wonder what it is about her that provokes such undeserved wrath --
maybe the perplexing mixture of pride and vulnerability, the sense at one
moment that she's leading you by the nose and the next that she has no idea
what she's up to.

Or maybe it's the way she looks: as though slightest touch would bruise her. 
As though wringing her neck would be as easy, as gratifying, as juicing an
orange.

"
S571: "The taste in the back of your throat makes you wonder if you're going to
be ill.  (Is this really you?  This nasty-minded brute?  We're dark inside, all
of us, but you'd thought more of yourself.)

"
S572: "No.  Your critical mind reasserts itself.  You've been interacting with
her long enough, perhaps, to begin to guess: this is a woman created by a man
who didn't understand women, or who didn't care for them.  All her
inconsistency, all her strangeness-- it's the artifact of someone who loathed
what he desired.  That explains, too, the repellent qualities in her grace --
the too-smooth skin, the mole on her arm, the way her neck is too narrow.

This isn't about you."
S573: "You don't stay to look longer -- later you may regret the cowardice that
prevents you from looking in this particular mirror, but there are limits to
endurance."
S574: "You close your eyes, your heart swift.  If what she says about herself
is true -- and you tend to think that it is -- then she deserves your pity. 
Nor would you ever offer violence to anyone, unless in self-defense...

Something's getting in the way of your thinking of her as a person.  With the
best will in the world, you're unable to stop feeling a kind of frost.  A
wrongness.  Fear.

You raise your eyes: "
S575: "she's still contemplating the drapery, preternaturally calm.  "
S576: "the light glints off her bare shoulder like sun on ice.  "
S577: "she's smiling, just a little -- isn't she?  "
S578: "there's something horridly knowing about the twist of her lips.  "
S579: "her eyes meet yours, unreadable.  "
S580: "

Not evil, but dangerous.  And that, perhaps, is inevitable, for a soul that
created itself, that was born of pity and pain, and found itself discarded."
S581: "The mood departs again, of course, and quickly.  It was just a stray
thought.  It meant nothing...  But you haven't had so strong a reaction to any
piece of art since you went to the Cancer Society installation.  And that was
timing.  It was only the timing that made that so bad.

You push aside the old weight, but the effort leaves you tired."
S582: "

"I know I loved him," she answers.  "
S583: ""While he for his part was wrapped up in his own affairs.  "
S584: "I told you that he might love that painter in Navplion;"
S585: "If he loved anyone it was probably that painter in Navplion I told you
about;"
S586: " in any case his moods were usually worse when he'd started to mention
her, and that is the only indication I have.

"If he did love her, though, either she didn't return his affection, or there
was some other problem...  Certainly he didn't feel about her the way I felt
about him."

"
S587: ""Now that he's dead, I don't know what I feel.  Everything seems to have
dried up and blown away.""
S588: ""And there was a time when I might even have said that he loved me, too.
 Things seemed simpler before I began to move, before I woke up.  I didn't
realize that you could loathe your own creation."

"
S589: ""So now you know.  That's all there is -- my one and only secret."  She
smiles, but it doesn't reach her eyes.  "All the rest of my life's just
circumstance."

"
S590: "A closing line if you ever heard one.  You give her a nod and walk away,
half your mind already on the buffet in the next room, and what you're going to
say about her, in there."
S591: ""So far," you reply.  And she smiles again, this time for real."
S592: "She turns away, facing the curtain as she did when you first came in.  "
S593: ""I know I'm just a toy to you," she says.  "But I think it's time for
you to leave me alone.""
S594: ""This is--"  She pauses, fishing for words.  "This is becoming strange. 
I think I'd be more comfortable if you left."

You nod, turning aside."
S595: "Unexpectedly, she reaches out and puts her hand on your shoulder.  The
warmth burns through your clothes.

A moment passes.  Then she bends and kisses you, full and sweet.

When she pulls away her eyes are full of tears.  What have you told her,
unwittingly, with the expression on your face?  And did she ever have a chance
to kiss "
S596: "him"
S597: "?

"Come on," you say gently, slipping an arm around her waist and helping her
step down from the pedestal.  "We need to talk, and this is not the place.""
S598: "You turn away.  At the end of the hallway light spills across the floor,
and calling to you.

You half expect her to say something as you walk away.  Something bitter or
mocking, to bring you back, to force you to confront her again.

She doesn't."
S599: "her shoulders are set in an ugly line, the first graceless thing you've
seen about her."
S600: "You turn away, suddenly tired of this exhibit."
S601: "  Galatea lifts her eyes to watch you go, a brittle gleam in her look. 
"
S602: "

"Thanks for telling me about Pygmalion," she says -- and you realize that it's
the first time she's referred to him by name."
S603: "

You don't even break your stride, walking out."
S604: "

You stop for half a second, then keep going.  This is "
S605: "not"
S606: " your tragedy, you tell yourself firmly..."
S607: ""It was a pleasure to meet you."

You hide a smile at this commonplace as you walk away."
S608: "There's a definite accompanying "and good riddance," in her tone, if not
in her voice.  Prickly little creature, yes indeed..."
S609: "

"Bored so soon?" she asks, in a flat voice."
S610: "  "I don't think you've done what you came to do -- you haven't proven
that I'm not a real person.  I've answered everything you've said."

Her forehead creases slightly.  "Right?  Haven't I?""
S611: "

You turn and look at her one last time.  "I have other things to do," you say. 
"And even your creator would admit that you're -- shall we say a bit rough
around the edges?"

She doesn't have any response to that.  You head off to get yourself another
glass of champagne."
S612: "

"There are other exhibits to see," you reply without looking back.  "But don't
worry.  I'm sure someone else will find you before too much longer.""
S613: "

"Goodbye," she says, as you walk away.  "Come back if you get bored out there."

"
S614: "You nod curtly, already thinking of the buffet in the other room."
S615: "You tell her what's on the placard.  She just stares back at you.  "If
I'm a fake person, why are you bothering to tell me this?" she asks.  "Are you
trying to get a reaction?"

You don't say anything, doubting for a moment yourself.  It would be, to say
the least, odd, but perhaps he really "
S616: "isn't"
S617: " dead; perhaps it's just something to say to get her to react.  Many of
these placards have lists of recommendations, like HINT: ASK ME ABOUT OPERA...
might this just be a subtler form of the same?

"
S618: ""The artist," you say gently.  "It says on the placard that he has
committed suicide."

"
S619: "Time passes, but she doesn't move."
S620: "  You are tempted to reach out to her, but the memory of the last time
you touched her still leaves you a little embarrassed.  As though you'd made it
obvious that you weren't thinking of her as an actual person...  The intention
would be just the opposite now, but the barrier is there.  So y"
S621: "ou just stand there, looking uselessly at the back of her head and
wishing that she'd turn around."
S622: "ou just stand there, looking at the side of her face and wishing you
understood what her expression meant."
S623: "ou just stand there, watching her downcast eyes and wondering whether
you were wise to say anything at all.  (Though surely she should know?)"
S624: ""I don't know," she says in a strained voice, "what I am supposed to do
now.  I only "
S625: "exist"
S626: " because of him, for his sake--"

You bite back a remark on the virtues of modern feminism."
S627: ""Standing up there isn't going to make this easier," you say.  "No one
owns you, but as long as you treat yourself like a work of art, you won't be
able to come to terms with your own humanity."

"
S628: "She makes a little sound, the faintest beginning of a laugh at having
her own tantrum thrown back at her.  "
S629: ""Why don't you come down from there?" you ask.  "It can't be
comfortable."

"
S630: "You have to stifle the urge to laugh at her sudden expression of dismay.
 (Get out of "
S631: "that"
S632: "want"
S633: " me to be alive," she says.  "Not fully.  Not as a human being.  He
didn't know how to deal with that.  If I'd stayed still, and silent, he could
have gone on telling me things.  And maybe if he'd had that outlet, he
wouldn't--"

"
S634: ""That he didn't want you to be alive was his failing, not yours."

(The words ring in your ears after you speak.  Would you want any creation of
yours to come to life and start talking to you?  Much easier to think of this
in terms of gender politics.)

"
S635: ""And so what would you have me do?  I have no skills, no family, no
money, no possessions other than the clothes I'm standing in --" she makes a
dismissive gesture that takes in all the yards of glinting green fabric -- "and
though I have reason to think that it was expensive, something tells me it
isn't practical for everyday use."

"
S636: "You smile at the image of her trying to file papers or wash a car in
that dress.  It's on your lips to say you'll look after her -- you more or less
have to offer, don't you?  No matter how inconvenient that might eventually
prove.  And perhaps it will come to that in a few minutes.  But it's not what
she needs to hear at the moment.

"Leap of faith," you say.

"
S637: "Her mouth quirks.  "All right, then," she says.  "Here we go."  Catching
up the excess of her gown, she jumps off, ignoring the hand you extend in
support.  The two of you walk out without looking back."
S638: ""Comfortable?"  There's a mocking bitterness in her voice.  "Do you
honestly think that I care, at the moment, about the fact that my feet hurt,
and my shoulders are bare, and that the spotlight is damnably hot?  I "
S639: "was"
S640: " bothered by that -- until you got here."

"
S641: "You're silent, not sure how to reply.  "
S642: "Her eyes lift, and she catches the stricken look on your face.  "
S643: "She sighs.

"Perhaps that was unfair.  I'm not acquainted with the etiquette of a situation
like this," she goes on, in a more restrained tone.  "But I don't know how I
could begin to face-- all of that, out there, the people milling around and
talking...""
S644: ""But I --"  She frowns slightly, evaluating what she was about to say. 
"Yes.  Yes.  After all, why not?"

Catching up the excess of her gown in one hand, she steps down, ignoring the
hand you extend in support.

"Won't this surprise them," she says.  "Did you see "
S645: "him"
S646: " here?  The artist?  You know what he looks like, don't you?"

"
S647: ""I didn't see him," you say heavily.

"Oh."  She frowns.  You open your mouth to speak again, but she outstrips you,
hurrying down the hall and into the bright throng.  And perhaps she'll be all
right..."
S648: ""I don't know," you reply.

"Well, whether he is or not, I've got some things to say to him.  And maybe
this'll shock the gallery into writing him a letter, or something.  I'd like to
see him come back and try to make me behave."  Her eyes laugh, and you watch
with amusement as she turns and walks down the hallway.  She seems younger than
she did a moment ago, but very much more alive."
S649: ""I'm not supposed to," she snaps.  "This is where I've got to stay.""
S650: "

"Of course," you reply soothingly.  "We wouldn't want, er, the gallery owners
to get "
S651: "angry"
S652: " at you.  For leaving your post.""
S653: "

"Says who?" you ask.  "You're your own, not theirs.  They're not paying you to
stand there, are they?"

But she doesn't trust you enough yet to listen, it would seem."
S654: "You shiver in a sudden blast of air conditioning.

"
S655: "You open your mouth to tell her that that's impossible, that she'll have
to live with whatever her feelings are.

"
S656: "You watch, bemused, wondering what sort of stunt this is.

"
S657: "And then you're alone.  There's only the marble, still and cold and
awkward in its gown.  (Later, you'll see her in a picture: they'll have taken
the dress off and started to display her naked again.)  Now, though -- now you
can't stand here, looking, any longer.  It's like being with a dead body.  And
you powerfully need a drink."
S658: ""So you're saying that I'm just programmed to respond to the idea that
he committed suicide, and everything is just a show.""
S659: "

You nod a little apologetically.  "You know, there are some points on which
your responses are vague or odd.  I wouldn't say you exactly pass the Turing
Test."

Her eyes shutter, go dark."
S660: "could"
S661: " prove it to you if I wanted to," she says.  "I bet none of your clever
mechanical people is allowed to hurt someone.  Am I right?  No violence.  That
wouldn't be part of the programming."  "
S662: "Her voice takes on a distinct menace.  "And to be honest, it has a
certain appeal.  Since you've been every kind of an ass -- don't look so
surprised that I know the word!"

You stand there calmly, admiring the sophistication of this argument and
wondering what went into programming it.  So it takes you by surprise when she
reaches out (disproportionately long arms, she has!) and catches you around the
throat..."
S663: "

(You were right, then, about the menace.)"
S664: "

She sighs.  "But there's another way, and at the moment I think it's the one I
prefer.  I've had enough of this-- all this."

"
S665: ""All I can tell you is whatever has been fed into my database, right? 
My collection of facts to share?"

"
S666: "(Damn.  You've reached a stage where she's simply uncooperative, it
would seem.  It annoys you extremely when artists create pieces that can get
into this state.)

"
S667: "She watches you coldly while you ponder this point.  "
S668: "You can detect a certain amount of tension in her stance.  "
S669: "When you turn and walk away, she says nothing at all."
S670: ""Maybe that was a misjudgment on my part," you admit.  "I'm sorry that I
offended you -- no offense was intended.  So let's continue this conversation
as rational people."

She doesn't move, but you detect some slight softening in her bearing.  Perhaps
you're forgiven."
S671: ""Galatea.  Look at me."

Her eyes flicker up and meet yours.  "
S672: "There's a strange blend of emotions in that look -- "
S673: " foremost, and under that a hint of "
S674: "; and something else smoky and elusive, to which you'd be embarrassed to
put a name"
S675: "Not the expression of an animate, no matter how sophisticated her
program or how subtly constructed her musculature."
S676: "With no particular warning, she dips her head and kisses you full on the
mouth."
S677: ""Are you sure you can stand the scrutiny?" she asks.  "So used to
looking, but perhaps not to being seen."

You open your mouth to retort, but it's true: the objective, deliberate way she
looks you over has you squirming a bit, eager to move, to distract her, to turn
the conversation to some new topic.  This was not exactly what you had in
mind."
S678: "Then her mouth quirks, and she looks you over deliberately.  You find
yourself struggling not to squirm under that gaze that seems to miss nothing.

At length she comes back to your face, and her expression softens.  "Don't
worry. "
S679: "I"
S680: " am not writing a review."

"Thank God for small favors," you mutter, looking away.

She reaches out, touches your chin, compels your gaze back to hers.  "Now we're
even."  "
S681: ""Have a look at yourself," you say. "Do you look like a human being?
Only in the most superficial sense."

Not answering, she extends her bare arms, running one thumb along the length of
the opposite forearm.  She stops when she reaches the hollow of her elbow. 
Head bent.  Light gleaming in her hair like a halo.

"I know I'm not human," she replies slowly.  "There's no pulse, there are no
veins.  But that does not make me what you say I am."

"
S682: ""Have a look at yourself," you say. "Do you look like a human being?
Only in the most superficial sense.  That threw me off.  But you also don't
quite look like a machine.  The musculature is subtle, and there's something
unusual about your eyes -- well, you won't be able to see that without a
mirror, and perhaps you wouldn't understand what I mean if you could see it."

"
S683: ""So you no longer believe that I'm one of these animates," she says.

"Right.  But it was confusing at first.  I came in here expecting to find one
thing and what I came across was something completely different, and utterly
outside my experience.  I'm asking you to understand that."

She nods thoughtfully.  "Fair enough.""
S684: ""Look at yourself," you say.

She glances over herself, shrugs.  "I look the way I always do," she replies."
S685: ".  "Enough of this.  I need to see these pieces myself.  I'm bored, and
you've persuaded me."

Without waiting for an answer, she gathers her dress in one hand and jumps
lightly off the pedestal.

At the corner she stops and looks back at you, tilting her head.  "Well?  Are
you going to give me the tour?""
S686: ""I've already told you everything there is worth telling," she says."
S687: ""What was it like, waking up?" you ask.

"
S688: ""It was night.  I had been able to hear, and see, for a long time -- it
was the talking, or the pain of being carved, that made me aware, I think.

"But one night-- he slept in a corner of the studio-- I heard him screaming in
his sleep.  More loudly than usual.  And I forgot that I couldn't move, and I
just stepped down and woke him."

"
S689: "She gains confidence as you do not interrupt.  ""
S690: "That's when I first heard about the things that I told you -- the
darkness, and the people not able to speak.  He never did tell me what it
meant, if it meant anything at all.  In any case at the time he seemed glad to
have me there."
S691: "At the time he seemed glad to have me there, to listen to him -- though
I think he thought that I was only another dream."
S692: "  It was only afterward that it became strange.""
S693: "  But afterward -- in the morning-- it was strange."  "
S694: "You studied art history in school, of course, but most of it left you
cold:  paintings, as much barrier as window, inviting but inaccessible;
sculpture, a little closer, but still nothing you could interact with.

The play between design and story, shape and movement, the artist's conception
and the viewer's desire -- that's what fascinates you.

That, and the sheer magic of a good animate."
S695: "she"
S696: " claims to know of art is a mural at the airport?  Pity..."
S697: "  It would not have been out of place, considering her supposed
backstory, to give her a few remarks on sculpture, or perhaps some thoughts on
the relationship of art and viewer."
S698: "  It's clear that no one has taken much time with her education, in any
broad sense."
S699: ""Not much.  I've seen very few pieces: myself, and the murals at the
airport -- and the latter, I am led to believe, do not quite count.""
S700: "Paintings leave you cold.  You know them -- their language, their
iconography -- as a requisite of your own pursuits.  But you don't much enjoy
them.  And you can't help being a little irritated with the lack of originality
when you see an animate that depends too heavily on a knowledge of existing
art. This is a new form. It deserves to be treated as such."
S701: "

It doesn't seem that she knows much about painting either -- other than as the
occupation of some woman friend of Pygmalion's."
S702: ""What do you know about painting?"

"Almost nothing," she replies.  "I know that there is such a thing, because "
S703: " used to tell me about a woman he knew who-- but I've never seen it
done.  It seems strange to me; how would you find the thing you're looking for,
in the paint?  It might not be there to start with.""
S704: "It sounds as though Pygmalion knew a painter woman in Navplion.  More
than that she hasn't said."
S705: "You don't have much information on the subject."
S706: ""Go on," you prod.  "'A woman he knew who...'?"

"Who was a painter," she finishes.  "Obviously."

"
S707: ""So he told you he knew a woman who was a painter?"

"Yes.  I don't remember her name; I'm sorry."

"
S708: ""I believe he met her in his travels," she says finally, when your
silence becomes pointed.  "In Navplion, in Greece.  She had an apartment over
the water.  There was a Venetian or Turkish fortress -- he didn't know which --
out in the middle of the harbor, that she used to paint over and over and over
again."
S709: ".."  And then: "I wonder if she knows he's dead.""
S710: "..  I don't know what happened between them, if that's what you're
wondering.  It might be that he was in love with her, but he would hardly have
told me that.""
S711: ""He used to talk a lot about a woman, a painter, he'd known when he was
in Navplion.""
S712: "You have a mental image of Galatea walking through an airport (how
strange that must have looked, anyway -- she doesn't look like she belongs in a
crowd), hustled along in a business-like fashion by the gallery owners, but
looking back over her shoulder at some cheesy public artwork of world peace and
commerce."
S713: "It's not clear what you have in mind."
S714: ""Why shouldn't the murals count?" you ask.  It's not the kind of idea
you imagine she would have developed by herself; someone has to teach you
aethetic sensibilities."
S715: ""You mentioned murals at the airport," you say.  "What were they like?""
S716: "

"They were all of such ludicrously sentimental scenes.  People meeting up from
different countries and bringing each other gifts.  Which isn't what the
airport is really like at all.  You have only to look around to see how angry
people are, and tired.""
S717: "She's mentioned not knowing much about sculpture, on the whole."
S718: "Sculpture is not your favorite medium, though it comes closer than
painting."
S719: ""What do you know about sculpture?" you ask.

"What, you think because I am a statue, I'm an expert?  I've barely seen
anything but myself; only the plaster model that "
S720: "

"I think he had some other pieces that he'd worked on, around the studio, but I
never got to see them; by the time my sight was fully developed, they were
gone.""
S721: "Your thoughts on the exhibit so far are varied.  The Komininsky is a
good piece, if a little limited; the Fairy Queen, more ambitious but less
successful, on the whole, though it does have a certain compelling aura of
wonder.

"
S722: "The real question, though, is what "
S723: "she"
S724: "You just hope it wasn't a tactical blunder, telling her about her
position in all this.  The thing is, it's not clear, with this piece, what
you're supposed to say.  With most animates there are a few well-defined areas
of conversation and you can easily navigate within them.  Here -- well.  Not
everything is as well cued as it might be.  There's an art to manipulating an
audience into doing what you want.  The artist seems not to have learnt it."
S725: "On this piece, of course, you haven't got a judgement worked out yet."
S726: "You've pretty much covered this territory.
"
S727: ""You do realize what kind of exhibition this is, right?" you ask.

"What kind of exhibition?" she asks stupidly.  "It's an art exhibition.  I'm
art.""
S728: ""So now that you know what kind of exhibit this is," you say -- and then
break off, not sure how to frame the question.

She rescues you.  "Do I have a new perspective on myself?  Do I "
S729: "realize"
S730: " that I'm not real?  Do I discover that all my memories are a cleverly
designed trick?""
S731: "

You're forced to nod, though you wouldn't have put it to her in those terms.

"
S732: "  Though perhaps it makes some sense of the way you've treated me as
though I were something to be prodded at, so that you could find out how many "
S733: "features"
S734: "responses"
S735: " I have and whether I know that I ought to mind being poked.  Still,"
S736: "  Though perhaps it explains your questions about the same things, over
and over -- is that one of the obvious features of a fake person, then? That
they can't be irritated no matter how often you ask the same thing?  They
should install them in reception desks and at information counters, then,
instead of museums--""
S737: "

(You open your mouth to tell her that, in fact, they "
S738: "do"
S739: " -- but she goes on before you can get a word in.)

"Well,"
S740: " I would think that the way I responded to the news of his death would
have cleared that up.  If you had any lingering doubt.""
S741: "

"That's just the thing," you say, pressing on.  "The other exhibits have these
too--" you gesture at the placard -- "and they give hints about how to elicit
the most interesting responses from --"

"
S742: "

"Yes, I suppose so," you reply.  "It's just confusing, what you're doing here,
in that case..."

"Where else would they put me?  They can't explain why I'm alive -- as a
conventional statue -- but here..."  You have to admit, she has a point."
S743: " you'd probably get better results from my program if you played along
with me."

(A classic question, of course: is it better, as a critic, to look for the
weaknesses in a piece, or to seek its strengths?  Any program can, sooner or
later, be broken; and looking too eagerly for the stress points often means
missing the virtues.)"
S744: ""You do realize what kind of exhibition you're part of, correct?" you
ask.  (This is your favorite question for the evening by far.  Some of the
other exhibits have quite clever responses.)

"
S745: "But she merely looks confused.  Bad setup on this one...

"An art exhibit," she says stupidly.  "What other kind is there?""
S746: ""Do you know what kind of exhibition this is?" you ask, feeling a sudden
pity for her.

"
S747: ""An art exhibit," she says stupidly.  "What other kind is there?""
S748: "an artificial intelligence exhibit.  The artists -- usually teams of
artists, actually -- construct bodies -- like yours, although I have to say
that yours shows an unusually high degree of precision.  And then they put in
machinery to animate the bodies, and programming to teach the bodies how to
speak to the viewers.  It's a kind of game.  I try to see if I can trick you
into acting in a way that a real person wouldn't act.  And most of the pieces
have some kind of back story and personality.  It's a kind of art, as well as a
technical skill."

"
S749: ""So I'm a machine.  According to you."  "
S750: "an artificial-intelligence exhibit.  The other displays have artfully
designed bodies, yes, but they also have programs to make them speak and think
in particular ways.  So you see--"

"You think that's what I am," she says.  "A fake person."

"
S751: "You grin a little apologetically.  "Perhaps you can understand the
mistake.  Under the circumstances.   After all the truth -- as you would have
it -- is far stranger.""
S752: "You've known the owners of this gallery for some time, though you'd
hardly count them close friends.  Sometimes motivated more by social ambition
and a desire to make a stir than they are interested in art, they nonetheless
have put on on surprising and original shows over the years."
S753: "

They don't seem to have treated Galatea very well, though.  Not that that's
necessarily surprising, but you'd kind of enjoy seeing her do something that
would upset their expectations."
S754: "

It doesn't surprise you to find that they've treated Galatea rather
indifferently."
S755: ""What are your owners like?"

"Aren't they out there in the other room?" she asks, surprised.  "That's where
they said they were going to be."

"Yes, of course," you say quickly.  "
S756: "your"
S757: " impressions of them.  Obvously you must have a different perspective
than I could."

She shrugs.  "I know too little about people to come to any kind of conclusion.
 And they don't talk to me much.  No one does, these days."
"
S758: "
It occurs to you that it would be great fun if you could get her to come down
from that pedestal.  It sounds as though her owners have been quite cavalier
with her; you'd love to shake up their expectations."
S759: ""I don't think they expected to find me there alone," she adds
reflectively.  "There was plenty of fuss and argument when they arrived about
where he might be, but I couldn't tell them.  I wish he hadn't done that.  It
put me in an awkward position, which I had no idea how to handle.""
S760: "You only have the bare account that she gave you --"
S761: " though she seems to have found it amusing, the visit of inspection on
which she startled the owners so much that one of them fainted.  In all
likelihood Pygmalion was not very specific about what they should expect to
find; perhaps they had come looking to see a work in marble, and found an
animate."
S762: " of the owners of the gallery coming out to Cyprus to see her, of the
artist hiding out somewhere until they had gone awayagain.  And what a strange
first introduction that must have been, to other people and society in
general."
S763: "You don't know much about how Galatea got sold."
S764: ""How did you come into the possession of your current owners?" you ask.

"
S765: ""He knew them from before," she replies.  "And when he wanted to sell me
he wrote them and they actually flew out to Cyprus to inspect me.  He told me
that this was a great honor and explained how I should behave, and then he left
to lie low a while while they carried out the inspection.""
S766: "She seems to have found it amusing, the visit of inspection on which she
startled the owners so much that one of them fainted.  In all likelihood
Pygmalion was not very specific about what they should expect to find; perhaps
they had come looking to see a work in marble, and found an animate."
S767: "It sounds as though the gallery owners went to Cyprus to have a look at
her; more than that you don't know."
S768: "It's not quite clear what you mean."
S769: "She doesn't seem to know what inspection you're referring to."
S770: ""When the owners came out to Cyprus to have a look at you, what
happened?"

"
S771: ""So they came in, took a look around, and saw me standing there in my
place.  They didn't realize at first that I could move and see them: he told me
to behave as though I were a statue, so I did.

"Then when they'd had a good look, I turned my head and started to speak.  It
was quite amusing.  One of them fainted.  He'd warned them what to expect but I
think they didn't believe him until they saw for themselves.""
S772: "Apparently she wanted to be displayed in a more casual way, but the
gallery owners overrode her ideas."
S773: "She did mention insisting on being displayed in clothing, but other than
that, it's not clear how much of this setup was her idea."
S774: "The setup here is about as minimal as you've ever seen -- no real
attempt to provide a setting or props, fairly few cues (other than the placard
itself) to tell you where to begin interacting with her.  Between the spotlight
and the velvet there's a self-conscious drama that most animate artists strive
to avoid."
S775: "Looking at all this, you're forced to wonder what it would be like to
stand on that pedestal yourself, patiently intercepting questions and comments;
not allowed to step down, even for a breather or a drink of water; the
spotlight blazing down on you."
S776: "Before you can delve into display issues you're going to have to explain
the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that point."
S777: ""Did you have any say in the setup of your own exhibit?"

"
S778: "I did insist on being clothed.  I'd gotten used to wearing clothes after
I started to move in Cyprus.  They put up quite a fuss, actually: said it
detracted from the impact, that the artist's intention was to create and
display a nude, etc.  I told them that the artist's intention had not included
the possibility of my waking up and being uncomfortable."

"
S779: ""Unfortunately, that's the only battle I did win.  I would have liked to
wear normal clothes and sit in a chair, but they explained that that was
absolutely out of the question.  I suppose I understand what they meant, but
this is not exactly the most convenient arrangement I could think of.""
S780: "All she's said about her costume is that the gallery owners chose it,
and that it is not what she would have picked herself.  Which makes a certain
amount of sense, all things considered."
S781: "Apparently she wanted to be displayed in a more casual way, but the
gallery owners overrode her ideas."
S782: "She did mention insisting on being displayed in clothing, but other than
that, it's not clear how much of this setup was her idea."
S783: "You haven't changed the fundamental impression you had when you came in:
it's an expensive dress, but it doesn't tell you much; anyone out in the other
room could wear something like that, and while it would be on the formal end of
the spectrum, it wouldn't stand out."
S784: "She doesn't seem to know what to say about that."
S785: ""Who decided what you would wear?"

"Oh, they did.  My owners.  I would have chosen something a bit more
comfortable, and with the fabric in a useful location.  There's so much below
the knee, you'd think they could have spared some for my shoulders...""
S786: "That's a rather uncomfortable-sounding story she told, about getting
here from Cyprus in a crate, just barely escaping the notice of customs."
S787: "She did mention having been in an airport..."
S788: "You don't have any particular thoughts on the subject."
S789: ""So when were you in an airport?" you ask -- envisioning her picking her
way among the crowds of leaflet droppers and cult members.

"It was when I was being inspected at customs.  I had to pretend to be a statue
again then.  It's difficult, but it worked.

"After we'd gotten past that point my owners took me out of the crate so that
they wouldn't have to push around a humungous box any more.""
S790: ""How did you get here from Cyprus?"

"Oh, I flew.  "
S791: "It was uncomfortable in the crate, and cold as well.  "
S792: "They had me in a crate -- which was uncomfortable, and cold as well.  "
S793: "But that was the only way for them to get me through customs, because of
course since I wasn't born anywhere I didn't have a passport. I did my best to
look still and motionless when customs checked me.  Fortunately they weren't
very thorough.""
S794: ""You realize, of course, that when I mention things like that, it's
straight quotation, remarks I heard while I was being carved.  I don't really
know anything about it.  So don't challenge me."

(Coward...)"
S795: "Never been to Cyprus, yourself; if you put your mind to the topic, you
have a hazy and probably inaccurate impression of warm gardens, groves of
fruit, dark-eyed women in bright scarves; crumbling stonework, and blood feuds
simmering.  All very romantic, and not very distinct from any other
Mediterranean island."
S796: "

By the sound of it, she doesn't know much about it herself, having spent all
her time in the studio or the studio garden, or looking out over the ocean."
S797: ""What do you remember of Cyprus?"

"Very little, except the studio itself; the only time I left it, except to
stand out in the garden and look at the ocean after I woke up, I was packed up
in my crate for travel.  So I didn't exactly get a clear view of the
countryside.""
S798: "Sounds as though she got through just barely, pretending to be a statue.
 (What a curious ability, to turn herself back into the image of stone."
S799: "  The effect isn't even all that appealing -- striking, yes, but
appealing, no -- and it must have involved extraordinary effort on the part of
the biomechanics people.)"
S800: "You've no real opinions on that point."
S801: ""What was it like going through customs?"

"I held very still and didn't breathe," she says.  "And I let myself look like
a statue again."  Before your eyes her skin seems to grow harder, less
receptive, and her hair seems like a single piece.  Then the illusion fades."
S802: "

You stand there staring for another moment.  Very odd effect, that..."
S803: "

(What force was it that did this to her?)"
S804: "She doesn't seem to have enjoyed travelling by crate, but then, who
really would?"
S805: ""And you didn't mind traveling in a crate?"

Wryly: "It wasn't exactly presented to me as an option.""
S806: ""Oh?"  "
S807: ""And?"  "
S808: ""And so...?"  "
S809: "Seems these days that you don't think of anything else.  Sometimes when
you're in the middle of a conversation with a real person, you find yourself
mentally critiquing their dialogue design, or wishing that someone had taken a
little more care with skin tone.

A little twisted maybe; but the study of animate design has actually led to a
new understanding of how conversational pragmatics work: you only realize how
many rules govern an interaction when you see them violated."
S810: "There are a dozen better people with whom to discuss animate design and
critical theory, standing around in the other room.
"
S811: ""I don't know anything about it," she says.  "If you'd asked me when you
first came in, I would have said that no such thing exists.  It's not possible;
the mind is something that only the gods can give, and not even all of them.""
S812: ""All I know about it is what you've told me yourself," she says.  "I had
no idea such a thing existed."

After a moment, she adds, "Such a skill sounds like the province of Athena.  "
S813: "She shakes her head.  "The term doesn't mean anything to me.""
S814: ""In fact," she remarks, "now that I think about it, this seems very odd
to me.  Do you ordinarily tell a piece what it is?"

"
S815: "She has you there: you don't.  Not your style of approach at all.  So
why did you tell her?

"I try whatever seems appropriate to the moment," you respond.  "I'm as much
reacting to cues you give me, as the reverse: it's a kind of skill to discern
where the artist is likely to have provided interesting responses."

"
S816: ""I'm not entirely convinced," she replies, a dry triumph in her voice."
S817: ""No," you say.  "But then, I suppose I've been in doubt for some time
that you're like the other pieces."

"
S818: ""Really?"

Ah, vanity.  You smile noncomittally and shrug."
S819: "Telling her about Hazar brought back old memories: you and Jenny,
awkward and childish, at the edge of the crowd, gradually working your way
forward into the circle of light around Scherezade; the glitter of gold and
fake jewels; the way those tawny eyes turned and fixed on you for just a moment
before passing over the rest of the crowd..."
S820: "Ah, Hazar.  The first animate you ever saw was his Scherezade. 
Groundbreaking."
S821: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S822: ""I remember the first time I saw a show by Hazar," you remark.  "I was
twelve years old -- this was the beginning of his career.  Primitive, primitive
stuff -- Hazar was a pioneer, but what he really understood was body mechanics,
and he'd been let down by the people who provided the neurals.  Minimal
database, slow search times, poor context matching.  But the vocal and facial
expressivity was phenomenal.""
S823: ""The kind of thing that's old, now, completely commonplace.  He had a
Scherezade who told stories -- her other interactivity was fairly slight.

"And there was a crowd around her ten deep."

"
S824: ""She was that beautiful?"

You grin.  "Oh, yes.  But that's not the point."  (You avoid veering off into a
speech about how animates are "
S825: "art"
S826: ", damn it, not just an assortment of virtual harem girls -- though some
viewers tend to view them that way.  Which is why a disproportionate number of
animates are female.  But Scherezade --) 

"-- she had "
S827: "presence."
S828: "Bhattacharyya.  A name to conjure with: massive installations, hundreds
of apprentices, props.  You walk into one of his exhibits and the real world
vanishes entirely."
S829: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S830: ""There's an artist named Bhattacharyya who is famous for his immersive
installations -- so big that they cover whole city blocks, with hundreds of
prop objects -- things that the animate characters are keyed to respond to in
interesting ways.  You can spend all day in there and not experience the whole
work of art.  Which is part of the point, I suppose.""
S831: ""But how can one person do all of that?  I took all summer, just by
myself,"  "
S832: "

"The chief artist on a project like that is a designer -- he handles the
overall vision, and attends to any especially important details -- but he
always has a workshop of people working under him.  Understudies to the art,
and also technical advisors of various kinds.""
S833: ""Interesting," she says thoughtfully after a moment.  "You'd think that
the effect of an installation would be even greater if the whole setting were
designed for it -- so that you didn't see gallery walls at all."

You think instantly of the Bhattacharyya installation last month. 
Theoretically you're a purist, not a large-scale simulationist.  But the
immersive experience he achieved left you with strange dreams and a lasting
nostalgia for a place that doesn't even really exist."
S834: "Mike Komininsky is one of those crazy guys who doesn't take himself or
anyone else particularly seriously, and yet somehow manages to come up with
some really impressive stuff.  His piece at this exhibit is right on the fine
line -- mingling with the guests, pretending to be his date."
S835: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S836: ""There's a piece by Komininsky in the next room," you volunteer. 
"Mingling with the guests.  He, ah, brought her as his date, actually."  You
and Mike go way back: you've always been fascinated by his genius for
subversion."
S837: ""It means that he can mediate between her and anyone who tries to talk
to her.  Being able to control the input gives him an unfair advantage.  Most
of the fun is watching them interact with each other, in fact."

"
S838: ""Bizarre.  And he doesn't find it uncomfortable to be romantically
involved with a--"

"He isn't "
S839: "actually"
S840: " involved with her, naturally.  It's a joke.  And anyone can see she's
not real because she has his signature tattooed across her right
shoulderblade.""
S841: ""Treating a piece of art as though it were a real person.  But I suppose
it goes hand in hand with putting a real person on display as art."

"Komininsky's Date is programmed to interact with him, and then to riff a
little bit on what other people say."  "
S842: ""In that sense she's almost not within the bounds of the exhibition
guidelines; the idea here is to have pieces as interactive as possible, and she
almost falls under the category of a restricted.  In any case, her limited
conversation is amusing, but it's not going to leave anyone confused.""
S843: "Quirin isn't one of your favorites, perhaps because his ambition often
goes farther than his abilities.  For all his brilliance and the extensive
patronage he enjoys, he isn't quite able to pull it all off.  And in person he
tends to get sulky about that fact.  Every critical remark he takes terribly
personally.

All that said, though, his Joan of Arc was an amazing piece of work."
S844: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S845: ""Philippe Quirin created a Joan of Arc that was stunning.""
S846: ""She didn't respond directly to the viewer.  There were other animates
-- a Dauphin, and some soldiers -- who were programmed to respond only to her. 
What the viewer said, she interpreted as the Voice of God.""
S847: "

In fairness, you're forced to add, "Of course, it's difficult to make several
animates interact convincingly.  There were glitches.  But it was a
breakthrough piece nonetheless."

"
S848: ""I really don't care," she snaps.  "Spare me the details about my
mechanical counterparts."

"
S849: ""Don't tell me," she says.  "I don't want to know about my competition."

"
S850: ""I'm surprised you're telling me about the other animates," she says
sarcastically.  "Since it might make me feel inferior."

"
S851: ""Don't tell me," she says petulantly.  "I really don't care."

"
S852: "Tsui works on restricted pieces -- deaf or blind animates, for instance,
or foreign-language speakers, or pets -- anything that doesn't need to have a
full set of responses.  This gives her more leeway to work on the remaining
aspects of the work."
S853: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S854: ""Tsui does some interesting work with restricted animates: her pieces
are handicapped (deaf-mute, for instance) in ways that very much cut down the
viewer's options to interact.  Then she concentrates on making the few
available interactions as complex as possible.""
S855: ""I suppose it depends on what you mean by 'works.'  It doesn't get her
much grant money from commercial R&D groups, obviously.  But as art, yes, some
of it is quite effective.""
S856: "Ah, VanItallie.  A sellout, writing games..."
S857: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S858: ""The concept of a moving sculpture," you remark, "has been used before:
most notably about ten years ago on the VanItallie gargoyle series.  Designed
to look and feel like carved stone after the effects of a few hundred years of
pollution.""
S859: ""It was a silly idea," you remark.  "Past the gimmick, they didn't have
much to say, so they didn't fare well in the critical community.  The gaming
applications were extensive, though.  VanItallie signed with Ludi and that is
the last the art world saw of him."

(And of course, his Gothic "Radcliffe's Folly" came out and turned him into a
household name.  Nothing like selling out.)"
S860: "That was uncanny.  Or something worse.  The way her skin shifted colors
and textures..."
S861: "An unfortunate fact of modern life.  You have faintly environmentalist
leanings, but too much inertia and too great a love of creature comforts to do
anything about them.  Not every worthy cause can be your cause."
S862: ""I don't know much about it," she says."
S863: ""What ARE you?" you demand.  "How can you make your skin turn dark and
rough, and then change back?"

"
S864: "She shudders after a moment.  "The effects of a few hundred years of
pollution," she repeats.  "That's not a pleasant idea for me, you know?"

You chuckle.  "Sorry--"

But your amusement breaks as you watch her.  "
S865: "The tortured relationship between game, art, and commercial animates is
a subject even you find tedious.  People always ask you about it at cocktail
parties -- and then turn aside halfway into your reply."
S866: "The tortured relationship between game, art, and commercial animates is
a subject even you find tedious.  People always ask you about it at cocktail
parties -- and then turn aside halfway into your reply.
"
S867: "You start to tell her about VanItallie's game, but it's obvious she has
no context for what you're saying.
"
S868: "You've already covered this ground.
"
S869: " came out with a game a few years back called 'Radcliffe's Folly,' in
which you're exploring a haunted mansion.  It's everywhere -- not just in the
animate theme parks, but in special installations in a number of cities -- and
the AI was repackaged into video games for people who don't have access to the
animate version."

"
S870: "perhaps because you've broken the artistic contract.  You're supposed to
take the leads given to you in the piece, not go off on some monologue about
external issues.  Still, she ought to have some kind of generic response to
things she doesn't understand--

"
S871: "  "Perhaps because I don't share in the beliefs or the -- the cultural
background, I suppose "
S872: " would have called it -- that would make sense of a house made
malevolent by lingering shades.  That is what you mean, isn't it?"

"
S873: "Gloria del Tredici is not your favorite artist."
S874: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S875: ""There's a piece by Gloria del Tredici -- it's in the Tate Artificial
now -- called 'Victim.'""
S876: ""A representation of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was raped by her
painting instructor at a young age and spent the rest of her life painting dark
and frightening images, often of men being bloodily done to death.  Salome. 
Judith with the Head of Holofernes.

"
S877: ""Never mind that, it would take too long to explain.  The point is that
del Tredici's Artemisia could only talk about one thing -- the man who attacked
her.  Obviously the rape had a great effect on the life of the real woman, but
the portrait was simply boring."

"
S878: ""But some people are like that --"

"Whatever art is, it should not be boring.  The fact that there are boring
people is an aberration," you cut in."
S879: "You don't have the patience to narrate the relevant details.  For that
matter, beyond the obvious iconography, you're a bit sketchy on the stories.
"
S880: "Before you can tell her anything about animates you're going to have to
explain the nature of this exhibit.  It's not clear that she understands that
point.
"
S881: ""There's a piece in the other room -- if you listen carefully you can
hear the bell sound that goes with it -- which represents the Queen of
Faerie--""
S882: ""--I don't know who that is--"

"A bit like a goddess, only not exactly-- a person with special powers.  In any
case.

"
S883: ""Tall, with long hair; silver-green robe; speaks in an Elizabethan
dialect.  The lighting is the best part, a shifting pattern of sun through
leaves.  Alas, goddesses and fairies are an old trope.  In order to work they
ought to be frightening as well as ethereal.  This one is merely pretty in a
quaint way."

"
S884: ""Curious," she says.  "There's so much I've never even heard of."

You expect her to go on, she looks so thoughtful, but she doesn't."
S885: "She makes a thoughtful sound in her throat.  "
S886: ""Did you hear that bell ringing just now?" she asks.  "I keep hearing
it.  All evening.""
S887: ""There many aspects to an animate: the body and costuming; behavior and
expression; the informational database.  And then there are incidentals --
lighting, environmental sound, smells -- which some artists don't bother with,
but which can be quite effective."

"
S888: "She nods thoughtfully.  "I can see how it could be an interesting job,"
she remarks.  "It's just confusing to find myself in the middle of this
situation where I don't belong...""
S889: "She listens with evident interest; once her distrust and discomfort are
set aside, she has a childlike curiosity about new things."
S890: "your"
S891: "You've already told her what you do.
"
S892: ""I'm a critic of artificial intelligence pieces"
S893: ".  Animates, they're called.  I'm writing a review of the exhibition.""
S894: ""Actually, I'm a critic; I'm writing a review of the exhibition."  (And
why, exactly, did you need to get that out in the open?)"
S895: "

"Why are you telling me that?" she demands.  "So that I'll be on my best
behavior and earn a good review?  This doesn't even make sense."  She rubs her
eye with the heel of one hand, "
S896: "and sighs.  "Please just leave," she whispers.

So you do.  Feeling faintly defeated, you glance over your shoulder at the
corner, but all you see is the back of her head, just as when you came in."
S897: "and you're hit with an involuntary sympathy.  This must all be so
confusing, so strange...

"Forget I said anything," you say gently.  "I believe your story.  The
circumstances misled me.  That's all."

She says nothing, but her shoulders relax.  A few strands of her hair have come
loose and glitter like a halo in the sharp light."
S898: ""Ah," she says.  "So you could tell immediately that I wasn't like the
others --"

When you're silent, she makes a funny gesture with her left hand, as though
she's throwing something away.  "Never mind, don't answer that.  You know now,
which is what matters.""
S899: ""I see.  I suppose in that case I ought to stand in my pose, so that you
can tell what the artist intended.  Moving around ruins the lines.  Or so I'm
told."

"That's quite all right," you reply.  "I think I can see the intent.""
S900: ""That's a bit vague, don't you think?" she says.  "There are so many
gods.""
S901: "She's mentioned Aphrodite and Apollo, Dionysus and the Muses; Hades;
Artemis.  You seem to remember that there are more, but classical iconography
is hardly an area you've had reason to research extensively."
S902: "She's mentioned the Muses, Aphrodite, Apollo...  It seems that Pygmalion
was no monotheist."
S903: "Your own position on religion is highly idiosyncratic and is perhaps
best described as bitter atheism: you're really pretty pissed at God for not
existing."
S904: ""Do you believe in God?  or gods?" you ask.  "Or universal forces?"

"
S905: "She laughs.  "You sound like one of those people at the airport!  Asking
me questions.  My owners didn't let me stay to talk to them, though I would
have.  I didn't know then that there are some people you're supposed to ignore.
 But to answer your question -- "
S906: " told me that there are gods, like the ones who lived on Thasos where I
was quarried, or on the citadels of the old cities, or in the sea.  He told me
stories about them: their exploits, and how they went to war, and how they fell
in love."

"
S907: ""There were nights when he would pour out the first of the wine to one
of them: to the Muses, to Aphrodite the Cyprian, to Apollo.  He said prayers,
and he made me be silent; to say the wrong thing to the gods, he said, is at
least as bad as not to speak to them at all.""
S908: "As she pointed out -- it never worked for you.  But then, you didn't
believe that anyone was really listening.  Interesting the kind of doublethink
you can get into, when you're desperate."
S909: "Prayer as she understands it seems to be a deal-making system, requests
for specific things from the deity tailored to your particular need."
S910: "What you know about the subject is limited to a few desperate addresses
to an empty sky."
S911: ""Explain to me what Pygmalion thought about prayer.""
S912: "

"I don't know that I can exactly offer a full explanation of his beliefs," "
S913: ""But to put it simply, he told me once that all the gods require our
observance, since to ignore them is to bring down anger; but that some gods are
special to some men.  Also, that if you want something specific, you must ask
the right one.""
S914: "Divine presence, apparently.  Attempts to come up with a precise
definition only led to mockery, and now you're inclined to leave the whole
subject alone.  Some things must be experienced to be understood.  Or
believed."
S915: "The power and presence of a god -- according to her definition, at any
rate.  Though from the way she talked about it earlier, it sounded as though it
referred to the mortal experience of those things, rather than the things
themselves."
S916: "It sounds like some kind of experience, but more than that is hard to
tell from context."
S917: ""Is this 'numen' you were talking about"
S918: " a word for something that exists in the abstract?  Or is it a
description of the mortal experience in the presence of the divinity?  Is it
real, or is it reaction?"

"
S919: ""I'm not sure the distinction matters," "
S920: "Your questions seem over-precise, at times."

You stifle a smile.  Editors have accused you of pedantry before, but never the
actual subject of a review.

She goes on: ""
S921: "When it comes to the gods, there is a great deal that cannot be
explained -- only experienced."

"
S922: ""And have you experienced this divine presence?"

"No.  But "
S923: " described it to me: the silence that listens, the light that sees.""
S924: ""What's numen?" you ask.

She pauses, thoughtful.  "I don't know how to answer that," she says
eventually.  "I always knew what words meant, when "
S925: " spoke them to me, and I know this one too -- but it doesn't have an
easy connection to other concepts that he gave me.

"I suppose the fairest explanation is that it's the quality of divinity: power,
wonder, majesty, mysterious significance...  None of those words quite gets it,
but that's as close as I can come to a definition.""
S926: ""As for what the gods are like, in the absence of humans, in their own
being, it isn't for us to know, or to say if we did know," she adds, in
afterthought."
S927: ""The exploits of the gods?" you ask.  "What sort of exploits?  Just
typical myth stuff, rapes and showers of gold and bulls and the underworld and
so on?"

"Yes, that; and other things.  He was fond of the story of Cupid and Psyche.""
S928: "She seems surprised that you don't know the reference.  "
S929: "She plainly takes your mythological ignorance in stride by this point. 
"
S930: ""Read your Edith Hamilton," she says.  "It's all in there.""
S931: ""I'm afraid a religion in which some gods are at odds with the others
doesn't make much sense to me.  How do you avoid offending them all at once if
one wants you to do one thing and another another?"

"
S932: "  "You just have to hope," she replies, "that you aren't particularly
interesting to most of the gods.  Sometimes they do people good, but most
mortals whom the gods find interesting end up dead as a result.""
S933: ""So the gods get along in a cooperative system, but some cover one task
and some another?  They never argue?"

"Of course they argue," she replies, sounding amused.  "It is not entirely
comfortable even on Olympus.""
S934: ""Maybe it doesn't seem very sensible, a system in which these supposedly
great powers are at odds with one another," she adds, seeming to take your
silence for skepticism or confusion.  "And not very dignified, either.  Divine
feuds, petty arguments.  That was the complaint I had, anyway.""
S935: "When you still say nothing, she goes on, hesitantly.  "He said that that
was the way it had to be, though.  Strength to balance strength.  The world is
complicated, and no single force would generate it the way it is.""
S936: "She's mentioned Aphrodite and Apollo, Dionysus and the Muses; Hades;
Artemis.  You seem to remember that there are more, but classical iconography
is hardly an area you've had reason to research extensively."
S937: ""Who are all the gods, then?"

"Well, I hardly know them all by name," she replies.  "There were only some
that he cared for, and he wasn't particularly thorough with my education. 
Aphrodite and Apollo, Dionysus and the Muses, bringers of madness; Hades, who
keeps the gates of hell; and once or twice he mentioned Artemis.  As for the
others, such as they were, he did not speak of them often.""
S938: "You have no thoughts on the matter."
S939: "She seems to believe that it was one of the gods who woke her"
S940: ", though she isn't clear on which it was."
S941: "; it would be interesting to know which she thinks it was."
S942: "It's unlikely that you'll elicit any more information on that topic at
this point."
S943: ""If one of the gods woke you, which one do you suppose it was?"

"I've no idea."
S944: "  If you mean you think it was Dionysus who did it, though, I must say
that that doesn't make much sense.  He'd have no concern with a creature like
me -- his domain is things that are already alive.""
S945: "  It wouldn't have been Athena.  He was not on terms with her.""
S946: "  I doubt it would have been Artemis, though.""
S947: "  Poseidon wouldn't have been the one, in any case.  It's not his style
to take an interest in the crafts of men.""
S948: "  Not the Muses.  They only inspire thoughts -- not life itself.""
S949: "  Surely not Apollo, though.  His interest in creative endeavor is where
it concerns the lyre -- and if I had been brought to life by the god of the
Sun, I think he might have left me with more of a tan," she finishes,
displaying her unnaturally white skin."
S950: "  Are you suggesting that it was Aphrodite?"  She laughs hollowly.  "If
so, the old girl has a twisted sense of humor.""
S951: ""Did one of the gods bring you to life?" you ask.

"
S952: ""That makes as much sense as any explanation," she says.  "He was never
able to tell me -- though I think he was far too angry to try, in any case. 
But I thought you didn't believe in the gods."

"I was asking to see what you thought," you explain.  "For the sake of
argument."

"Ah.""
S953: "  And, according to her, the ruler over shades and the husband (by
nefarious methods) of Persephone."
S954: "The idea seems a little sinister, even to you."
S955: ""The god of the underworld," she says.  "He ruled over the shades,
accepted sacrifices of black sheep.  Stole Persephone and fed her pomegranite
seeds so that she would be forced to stay with him some part of every year...""
S956: "  You knew that much to start with.  And as you recall, Galatea
mentioned his uncomfortable relationship with his wife Hera, his seductions of
mortal women, the lightning bolt with which he punished the unjust."
S957: "Why?  For power?  For strength?  For justice?  And would you receive
them?"
S958: "To your surprise, she takes you seriously.  "Zeus all-father," she says,
"if ever Pygmalion who made me pleased you with an offering of wine, if ever he
burnt the fat of a cow in your honor, hear me now.  I am given life, but not
life as others know it.  Give me a mortal body.  Make me human."

"
S959: "Silence.  Light moves along her arms, gilding her.  The sheen vanishes
from her skin.  A flush of blood shows under her cheeks.  She turns to you, her
eyes wide.

"Galatea--"  You put out your hand to catch her -- she seems to have lost her
balance -- and she leans toward you just in time to be sick all over your
jacket and shirt.

"
S960: "is"
S961: " this stuff?"  Her hair is sticking to her forehead.  She looks like a
child with a fever, and she keeps making faces, trying to get the taste out of
her mouth.

You just shake your head, gingerly stripping off the jacket.  "As an
introduction to the capacities of a mortal body," you remark, "that was perhaps
a bit harsh."
S962: "  Quite unfair as well, considering that you've never even had anything
to eat."
S963: "  But then, you did want the experiences of childhood, and puking
everywhere is definitely one of them."
S964: "She laughs a little unsteadily.  "He always said the gods never give an
unmixed gift.""
S965: "She shakes her head.  "I hardly know what I would ask of him," she
replies."
S966: ""What do you know about Zeus?"

"He was the father of the gods, of course," "
S967: ".  "Perpetually feuding with his wife Hera, always off sleeping with
mortal women; but also a god of justice who punished wrongdoing with a bolt of
lightning.""
S968: "She seems fairly comfortable with the idea that there is some kind of
absolute of justice supported by an absolutist deity.  Not a product of the
modern world, with its slippery moral boundaries and conflicting traditions..."
S969: "That would seem to be the province of Zeus.  But more than that she
hasn't really said."
S970: "Justice and swift punishment for wrongdoing are appealing ideas in the
abstract; they just don't seem to apply to much of what you've met up with in
life."
S971: ""So you believe in a swift absolute punishment for wrongdoing, someone
who sits up there in the clouds judging and distributing instant retribution?"

"
S972: " told me, and he got it from stories, which he himself probably only
half believed.  And even in those stories, the divine retribution only works
that way some of the time -- usually when you've personally offended the gods. 
If you've merely been naughty, your children may wind up cursed and you
yourself get off...  It's not a failproof system.""
S973: "

"I do like the lightning bolts, though," you say.

"Yes," she agrees.  "A nice touch.""
S974: ""That assumes that there is an absolute justice that can be supported. 
What about the mitigating circumstances, the situations where there are no
right answers?"

"Then you need the wisdom of Athena.  The system is complex and
interdependent.""
S975: ""I told you," she says.  "Some arguments are beyond me.  I have the
nebulous beginnings of an opinion, but I don't know the words that would give
it shape.  And I don't have the life experience to back it up, either.""
S976: ""Do you believe in justice?" you ask.

"
S977: ""That's a large and hazy question," she replies, a little too
intelligently.  "And though I have some ideas, I think I lack the vocabulary to
argue them at this point.""
S978: ""So Zeus was sort of an immortal Don Juan?"
S979: "  How nice.  Is he still doing it, or has he retired?"

"
S980: ""All of Pygmalion's stories seem to have referred to a long time ago,"
she says, a little hesitantly.  "But now that you mention it, that doesn't make
much sense.  It stands to reason that he wouldn't have changed.""
S981: ""So you think he's still out there?  Fathering half-divine children?"

"
S982: "  Silence.  "Maybe," she admits, after a long time.  Then: "I can't tell
if you're teasing me."

"Just trying to follow things through to their logical conclusion," you assure
her."
S983: "  A cold and clever force for whom Pygmalion had no use."
S984: "She shakes her head.  "I told you," she says.  "The grey-eyed goddess is
no patroness of mine.""
S985: ""I have nothing to say to Athena," she replies.  "She is a goddess for
crafts and wars, and I have no knowledge of the one and no desire for the
other.""
S986: ""What do you know about Athena?"

"Not terribly much," "
S987: " had no use for her.  Said she was clever and soulless, and that the
world needed no more cold women than it already contained.""
S988: ""When did you learn to think?" you ask.

"When did you?" she retorts.  "Did you notice?"

Naturally not.  "I was wondering, merely, whether there was a difference for
someone who was -- not born in the womb.""
S989: ""Actually," she adds, "that's a point I hadn't thought about."  "
S990: "

You wait.

"Can the gods give minds, or do they simply exist?  Is the mind something that
-- what?"

You stifle your chuckling.  "It's a good question," you reply.  "But no one has
solved it yet, nor is anyone likely to.  There are some who would say that we
are all machines of a kind, and our thoughts are merely products of the
mechanism; and there are others who would call that the rankest heresy.""
S991: "She shrugs at this suggestion.  "I've no special need to do so.""
S992: "What you know about Apollo is limited to what she's told you: that he
was an archer, and a god of prophecy.  And that he had some kind of negative
association with Dionysus."
S993: "You don't know much on the subject."
S994: ""What did he tell you about Apollo?"

"That he is an archer, of course," she says, "and a prophet; the god of the
sun, the representative of civilized song, the opposite of Dionysus."

"
S995: ""He also warned me not to trust Apollo.  He said he'd tried, and found
it ineffective.  Civilization only goes so deep and under that is mere anarchy.
 As he put it."  As an apparent afterthought, she adds, "Dionysus presided at
Delphi three months of the year, you know.  Apollo did not hold even his most
sacred precinct absolutely.""
S996: ""I don't know much of prophecy," she says.  "It was not a talent "
S997: " possessed, though he liked to claim he knew what was coming.  He had no
idea whatever; he was constantly being surprised.

"But there were times when he ranged around muttering to himself about what was
to come.  Which was his cynicism talking, or despair.""
S998: ""What's augury?"

"Divination through the behavior of birds.  Romulus and Remus used it to
discover who would be king in Rome.  A dead art, but not without appeal."

(When she sounds like this, you're sure it is his voice you're hearing; a
little more arrogant, a little more self-assured, and a little more human than
her own.)"
S999: ""What do you know about Delphi?"

"
S1000: ""It was the oracle of the Pythia -- where she sat,"
S1001: ""Ever hear of Delphi?" you ask.

"Of course.  Where the Pythia sat,"
S1002: " muttering jibberish into the smoke, so that the priests could make
hexameters out of what she said.""
S1003: "She gave you a pretty textbook description of the goddess -- 'love and
generation' -- but she seemed a little touchy on the topic.  Perhaps there's
some additional point you're missing."
S1004: "Goddess of desire and reproduction."
S1005: "She seems disinclined to do anything of the sort, and you wouldn't want
to press the matter."
S1006: ""Pray to Aphrodite," you say.

"For what?  She doesn't bring the dead back to life," she replies bitterly. 
"She only deals with those of us on this side of Styx.  There's no marrying and
giving in marriage, in Hell.""
S1007: ""Why not pray to Aphrodite?"

"Because there's nothing I would like to ask of her," Galatea snaps in reply."
S1008: "sounds like a harmless and pleasant sort."

"
S1009: ""Pleasant and harmless," she repeats in a dull voice.  "She's the one
who sent Helen to Troy; she's the one who made Zeus chase after all sorts of
mortal women, to their disadvantage and Hera's fury.  If it weren't for her and
her tricks and her cruelty--"

"
S1010: "She pauses, her eyes flickering up to something behind you.  You turn.

"
S1011: ""It is unwise," says the newcomer, "to rail against the gods. 
Especially against those who have done you favors."  She walks toward where you
are standing: from a distance she looks like one of the gallery owners, but
when she is beside you you realize that this is an illusion: close up you
notice how tall she is, and how the light seems to follow her of its own
accord.  There's a smell of something sweet and unfamiliar.

"
S1012: "But Galatea stares the goddess down.

"There's nothing you can take from me that I have not already lost," she says. 
"If it is indeed you who are responsible for my being alive, then it is a
pitiful gift -- since at the same time you took away the only person I cared
about."

To your surprise, Aphrodite frowns.  "I did not take him away.  He took himself
away -- and I am sorry, indeed.  He was one of my favorites among men.  But I
cannot bring him back to you."  She reaches up and with one hand wipes away the
tears from Galatea's face.  "
S1013: ""But while you are alive there are always consolations."

The goddess leans forward and says something else, in too low a voice for you
to make it out.  But you see Galatea's gaze flicker towards you."
S1014: "But the goddess seems hardly to notice you.  She touches Galatea with
one finger and instantly the life is gone from her: there is only a statue on
the pedestal, perfect, still.

"
S1015: ""You killed her!" you exclaim, horrified.

The golden gaze turns on you, lovely, quelling.  "
S1016: ""Oh, did you want her?"  She smiles nastily.  "There are plenty of
other women in the world."  And she goes out, leaving you there alone."
S1017: "Too appalled and too miserable to speak, you huddle against the wall. 
Aphrodite glances once, contemptuously, in your direction, as she goes out."
S1018: ""What do you know of Aphrodite?"

There's a long silence, a stillness in the room.

"
S1019: ""The goddess of love," she says finally.  "And the source of all
generation."

(Right.  It didn't take her that long to come up with that textbook
definition."
S1020: "  Glitch in the neural programming, perhaps?"
S1021: "  Hit close to home some way, perhaps?"
S1022: "Perhaps you'd best leave that topic alone now."
S1023: ""What do you know about love?"  (As long as you're catechizing her, you
might as well be thorough.)

"
S1024: ""That it makes people behave like idiots," she replies harshly.  "That
it takes more than it gives.""
S1025: ""I did love him, for whatever that's worth, and whatever it means." 
She sounds a little desperate, as though she's trying to explain something as
much to herself as to you."
S1026: "Indulging your one-track mind isn't going to get this job done any more
quickly."
S1027: "Oh, really.  There are some things that fall outside your job
description.
"
S1028: "The question startles even you, the moment you've uttered it.  "
S1029: " sleep with me-- no, he didn't."

No.  He wouldn't have.  Just look at her: she's beautiful in a crystalline way,
but the more you look at particulars, the more they disturb.  No one is so
sleek, so unforgiving. The proportions are subtly wrong, too -- the size of the
head, the shape and width of the mouth..."
S1030: "

That's it, then.  You could stay and question her, and maybe find out more --
if she knows more -- about the tortured persona of the artist.  But you're
bored with sexual angst.  It's one of those topics that everyone uses and no
one has anything interesting to say about."
S1031: "One phrase of hers rings in your head: "He told me they gave him the
means to face the other forms of madness..."  A dubious sort of blessing at
best, but the man seems to have been not entirely at ease with his own creative
process."
S1032: "You only know them as a symbolic entity representing creative
inspiration."
S1033: ""I'm their object," she says.  "I've no creative power myself, nor any
wish to wield any.""
S1034: ""What did he tell you about the Muses?"   (An artist's idea of his own
inspiration is usually fascinating though sadly incomplete.)

"
S1035: ""He said that they were the only gods who had not deserted him
entirely.  He told me that they gave him the means to face the other forms of
madness -- and though I sometimes wondered what that meant, I'm glad he felt
so.""
S1036: "You are only an observer of art, not a creator of it."
S1037: ""He used to talk about his Muses," she says, evidently following on her
own train of thought.  "I didn't know for the longest time what he was talking
about.  In fact, I still don't really understand.  I never saw them; if they
were in the studio with us, they never showed themselves.""
S1038: "The god of the sea seems not to have been one of Pygmalion's personal
favorites."
S1039: "The name reminds you of a picture you saw in a travel magazine not long
ago, of the temple of Poseidon at Sounion.  White marble on a cliff, over a
terribly blue sea."
S1040: ""Pray to Poseidon?" she echoes contemptuously.  "For what?  That the
sea will rise and wash me away?""
S1041: "That suggestion found little favor with her last time."
S1042: "A goddess of marriage and the home, apparently, and the wife of Zeus."
S1043: "Your knowledge is sketchy at best."
S1044: ""Why not pray to Hera?" you ask.

"
S1045: "

"I'm not exactly a good housewife with a husband and children and a home to
look after," she remarks.  "Hera's interests lie elsewhere, with people who
have oaths and ties and relatives and connections.""
S1046: "That suggestion found little favor with her last time."
S1047: ""Of course," she adds meditatively, "Zeus was unfaithful, but Hera
doesn't sound as though she was easy to live with.  Jealous, yes, I can
understand that, but she took it out on all the wrong people.  And scheming,
and conniving.""
S1048: "What did she say?  Virgin huntress, goddess of the moon, the sister of
Apollo and the daughter of Zeus.  (These gods have a complicated family tree.)"
S1049: "She seems to have answered that suggestion pretty conclusively."
S1050: ""I have nothing to say to the goddess of the hunt," she replies.  "She
is mistress of beasts, and there are no animals here but the caged kind; she
brings light, but there is no need of the moon when you have-- that sort of
thing."  She gestures at the spotlight.

"If her influence still exists, it is far from here, where the wilderness is.""
S1051: "Once when you were a child your parents took you to New Mexico, and
that is what you remember when you hear the word: standing on the edge of a
mesa, looking at a stretch of land that ran empty all the way to the mountains,
without cities or gardens."
S1052: "You've said what you have to say.

"
S1053: ""There isn't much wilderness left," you say.  ""
S1054: "Not of the kind you're thinking of, anyway.  "
S1055: "We have too many people now not to use the land, if not for cities then
for farms, or mining, or the storage of waste.""
S1056: ""It does not surprise me," she says.  "From what little I have seen,
you do not seem to be people who care to leave things intact.""
S1057: ""Io, Bacchus!" she shouts, so loudly that the sound echoes off the
walls.

"
S1058: "What happens next comes all at once.  There is a tremor in the floor
like the beating of drums.  The air conditioner rattles, the vent disgorges
dozens of emerald snakes.  The curtain becomes a tangle of vines.

A man steps through them, a young man, with curling blond hair and a smooth
face, carrying a strange rod with a pine cone at the end.  When he sees you, he
smiles -- a sweet menacing smile that makes you take a step back.

"
S1059: "His attention turns to her.  He taps her with the end of the wand, and
the stiffness and the posed quality leave her.  She follows him.  Called to,
she does not turn around.  The vines part.  She is gone.

"What have you done to her?" you demand.

"Set her free.  I could do the same for you.  "
S1060: "But I forget: you value your-- self-control."  He salutes you, a
mocking gesture, and follows Galatea through into the darkness.

"
S1061: "If you like.  You stare around at the the vegetation thick on the
ground, think of the city outside, and the vanished wilderness.  The beat of
the drums is so strong through the floor that it seems to drive your heart.  

Smiling, the god touches you."
S1062: "You stare at the vegetation, embarrassed -- by your sudden longing to
follow Galatea, by your doubts, by your inability to understand what the god is
offering you.

"Choose, but choose now," he says.  "Yes or no?" >  "
S1063: "
He recognizes, without your having to speak, your unwillingness to try what he
offers.  With a disdainful shrug, he turns and follows Galatea through the
curtain.

"
S1064: "
"Yes."  For half a moment it flashes before you what you have to lose -- your
life, your sanity, your position -- and then

"
S1065: "


in the darkness, drums and flutes
   on the ground honey and a sweet flow of wine

"
S1066: "         and all around dancers, hands and eyes


"
S1067: "You stare, disoriented, at the moon, vivid through the ceiling.  Then
it fades, and there is only the spotlight, and the white walls, and the empty
pedestal."
S1068: "His sphere seems to be wine and the theater; anarchy, and illusion; the
destruction of order."
S1069: ""God of wine and drama," she replies smoothly.  "And a dangerous
eastern influence, as well.  Elusive.  Able to create illusions.  A breaker of
bonds, a bringer of freedom, a force for anarchy and the end of social order.""
S1070: "The end of inhibition, the end of constraint...

"
S1071: "The prayer speaks itself through your mouth.  As soon as you have
willed the act, the need for thought leaves you.  In fact it's not exactly
clear to you what you're saying.  The syllables are of an old language, with
deep vowels and strong consonants: a summons, and a song.

"
S1072: "


And in the darkness, drums and flutes
   on the ground honey and a sweet flow of wine

"
S1073: "         and all around dancers, hands and eyes


"
S1074: "The word brings to mind a particularly ineffectual political
demonstration a few years back, but nothing other than that."
S1075: ""So underneath the power of Apollo is this seething chaos that cannot
be made orderly?"

"Something like that.  The power of nature, desire, conflicting things that
refuse to fit simple rules and go into boxes.  But also freedom, energy, and
rejuvenation, the province of Dionysus.""
S1076: ""So anarchy is somehow a good thing?"

"Not all the aspects of all the gods are good.  Poseidon is a force of raw
power, often destructive -- certainly widowing enough sailors.""
S1077: ""What about the anarchic powers of nature?  Is Zeus opposed to those?"

"I think he has an uneasy relationship to them," "
S1078: "  After all it's obvious that Aphrodite has some power over him,
anyway.""
S1079: ""So some gods promote order and some promote the opposite?"

"That's just the beginning," she says, seeming amused.  "Since many gods have
more than one aspect.""
S1080: ""What sort of freedom is it that Dionysus brings?"
S1081: "  I assume he didn't go around freeing slaves."

"The end of cares," she says.  "No pain, no grief, no constraint.  No stiffness
or inhibition.""
S1082: "

"What you're feeling now; could he cure you of that?"

"
S1083: ""Or what you felt, when your sister died?"  "
S1084: ""Yes, I believe so.  At least for a time.""
S1085: ""You say Dionysus takes away inhibitions and constraints."
S1086: "  But that sounds a bit dangerous to me."

She laughs.  "Dangerous?  All the gods are dangerous!  But the idea is to get
outside the boundaries of yourself, not to be trapped by your fears and your
habits.""
S1087: "

"So in order to gain freedom, you first surrender your will," you say.  "That
doesn't sound like an entirely wise exchange.  What is freedom if you have no
control over where it leads you?"

"There is a price to everything," she replies enigmatically."
S1088: ""I'm still not sure I understand about Dionysus and perception."

"
S1089: ""What's left to understand?  Bear in mind he's the god of wine, too; in
modern society, all sorts of recreational drugs would doubtless fall under his
purview."

"The god of 'shrooms and E," you say disbelievingly.

"
S1090: "A belated alarm goes off in your mind.  "
S1091: "Just explaining?"
S1092: "  Who is she to explain things to you about modern society?  Or is that
some kind of misprogrammed generic response?"
S1093: ""Why would you want a god of illusion?" you ask, bringing the
conversation back to an earlier point.

"
S1094: ""Perhaps illusion is not quite the right word.  Many of his tricks
involve a shift in perception: what you see is a spiritual truth to which the
overly literal are blind.  But there's considerable danger involved.  If you
don't treat the vision with respect, the result is not understanding, but
insanity.""
S1095: ""Is there something you're trying to tell me?" you ask suspiciously. 
"Speaking of stepping out of character..."

"
S1096: ""That business about disguised identity," you say.  "That was a
remarkably odd speech for someone in your position to make."

"
S1097: "For a moment she doesn't say anything, and you wonder if you've made a
mistake.  And then you remember an article you were reading last month--

"
S1098: ""You're an avatar, you've got someone controlling you in realtime!"

The reply, when it comes, is not from Galatea.  The velvet curtain moves
violently; tiny gold tacks shower out of the wall; half the backdrop wrenches
free, thanks to the opening of a door beyond.

"Hi," says the newcomer.  "Behold the Great and Powerful Oz," she adds under
her breath.

"What?"  You stare down at her: she's rather short, a little on the dumpy side,
and dressed in a ripped pair of blue jeans.  An unlikely source for that
performance you just observed.  

She cocks her head to one side.  "Sorry to disappoint, " she says with a smile.
 "It was an experiment that -- well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  I
was curious what people would say.  Hope you don't take it personally."

"
S1099: "You glance at Galatea -- lifeless now that her controls have been
switched off -- and then back at the artist.  "You could start by telling me
your "
S1100: "real"
S1101: ""It seems strange to me," you say, "to have a god who condones the
disguise of identity.  I realize that it's a pagan system, of course; but
lying...?"

"Not lying," she interrupts quickly.  "No.  The presentation of truth in a
different form; often of a truth that would otherwise have to stay hidden.  The
feminine aspect of men, the undomestic aspect of women, the untamed aspect of
the citizen.  You shouldn't think in such straight lines," she adds, half under
her breath."
S1102: "

"It's related to the idea of masks and drama," "
S1103: ""Disguised identity.  Cross-dressing.  All those things that let you
behave outside the rules, redefine your identity for yourself, encourage people
to treat you in ways they otherwise might not."

You find yourself staring at her curiously.  What would she know about masks
and disguises?"
S1104: ""I didn't go to church, if that's what you mean.  "
S1105: " had no use for that.  We could hear the ringing of the church bell, up
at the studio, but he always said that was a sop for people who didn't dare
take on the gods in their raw form.  As pagan, and unkind."
S1106: ""  A wry smile crosses her face.  ""
S1107: "As you may have gathered, he wasn't exactly an optimist.""
S1108: "It sounds as though Pygmalion had a little ritual of pouring wine on
the ground in honor of the gods.  Little other than a superstition, the kind of
thing that you find in a lot of primitive cultures.  Women who pinch off a bit
of the bread dough and deliberately burn it as a sacrifice, or whatever."
S1109: ""So you said he poured libations," you remark.

"
S1110: ""So you say he poured wine to the gods?" you prompt.

"
S1111: ""It's a practice to honor the gods.  He used to tell me that he
couldn't afford to offend them "
S1112: ""He used to tell me he couldn't afford to offend the gods "
S1113: "any more than he already had.  Though I hardly see how that is
different from the behavior of the villagers, praying to their saints -- and he
always laughed at them.""
S1114: ""The gods lived in the old cities, and protected them: Athena in
Athens, Hera in Sparta.  And what the people needed, they could provide, if
fate did not prevent them."

She pauses, and you think she's finished.  "
S1115: "  "You don't have any such thing in this city, do you?  Or you don't
know it if you do.  I've seen what your statues depict.  Fat men in suits.""
S1116: ""No, don't touch me!"  She withdraws from you.  "Don't touch me.""
S1117: "

She is breathing like a runner.  "You act as though all this were a game.  As
though my grief were invented for you.  But it isn't; that's what frightened
him.  I'm "
S1118: "real"
S1119: ", do you understand?  No one carved this into me!""
S1120: "

Your cheeks sting a little.  It's hard to believe that that was fake, that it
was planned.  Perhaps she has feelings after all -- and if she does, it's
deeply embarrassing the way you've been thinking of her as an elaborate
conversation machine."
S1121: "

"I know," you say, swift and low.  "I know."

She raises a hand to her face, and sighs.  "
S1122: "It's hard to know what to make of the artist's suicide -- since you
didn't know him at all."
S1123: "It's not exactly your favorite topic.  (You brush aside -- Jenny -- and
old wounds.)"
S1124: "You don't have anything to say on the matter.
"
S1125: "She knows of the artist's death.  To belabor it further would be the
height of cruelty.
"
S1126: ""I wish I could die," she says.  "I wish I had been born an ordinary
woman, and could depart as ordinary women do, and follow him.

"
S1127: ""But he made me -- does it say this too, on that placard? -- he made me
of marble of Thasos, "
S1128: "the hardest kind.  He told me often enough: he made me to endure.""
S1129: "

She's silent for a long time.  "But after all--" she whispers, her voice
speculative.  "What do I owe him?  To endure in the heart, or only as he made
me?"

"
S1130: ""Do you fear death?"

She shrugs.  "Should I?  Am I really alive?""
S1131: ""Mine?  Or yours?"

Before you can answer, she lifts one shoulder in a delicate shrug.  "It doesn't
matter which you mean, since I know nothing about either.  You will go your way
when the time comes; and I--  Who can die who is not alive?""
S1132: "When you don't reply, she says, after a moment, "It hardly matters. 
There are many things worse than not being."
S1133: "  And the worst of them has already come to pass.""
S1134: "You don't have anything to say on the matter.
"
S1135: "She knows of the artist's death.  To belabor it further would be the
height of cruelty.
"
S1136: ""What do you think about suicide?" you ask her.

"I don't," she says.  "Should I?  It doesn't quite pertain to me, you know. 
These aren't wrists you can cut.  I don't need to breathe, I don't need to eat.
 None of my vulnerabilities are things you can die of.""
S1137: "She clearly doesn't know what you're talking about."
S1138: ""Why do you think he did it?" you ask."
S1139: "

"He was miserable," she snaps.  "
S1140: ""I told you about the nightmares that he used to have.  "
S1141: ""He was haunted; he couldn't sleep without nightmares, of people who
were dead, and still couldn't speak to each other; of shades passing each other
in the dark."
S1142: "
"Perhaps, but most people don't kill themselves for the sake of a few bad
dreams."  You say it as gently as you know how.

"
S1143: ""I told you how lonely he was," she says.  "Evidently my company was
not an acceptable substitute.""
S1144: "Nonetheless, her shoulder hunches, and she puts one arm across her
chest protectively.  "Obviously it wasn't just the dreams.  Something was
behind them -- but he didn't tell me what it was.  I only know that he spoke to
no one, knew no one.  There was a woman who brought food for the house, but she
never came in while he was there.""
S1145: "
A singularly unsatisfactory story, all things considered.  There must be more
to it -- a botched love affair, a child lost to disease, abuse, rape.  Some
past trauma festering gangrenously out of the past.  There isalways a sordid
backstory to pieces like this."
S1146: "You've told her about as much about that as you care to go into for one
evening."
S1147: ""I mentioned my sister," you begin, a little awkwardly; and she nods. 
"She died just a few years ago, of lymphatic cancer.""
S1148: ""I lost my sister a couple of years ago to lymphatic cancer."  It may
do no good to tell her this; but you feel that you owe her.  "She was
thirty-three.""
S1149: ""And?  Did you wish you were dead too?""
S1150: "

"No, I did not."  Your voice is hard in your own ears.  "I'd just spent three
months watching Jenny struggle to keep her life.  It would have been the worst
kind of memorial to throw away what she was unable to hold onto.""
S1151: "

Too late you realize how inapplicable this is, how little it touches her
situation.  "That doesn't mean--" you begin, stumbling to repair...

"
S1152: ""Don't."  Her voice is like the snap of crystal.  "I wouldn't expect
you to understand his reasons.""
S1153: "

So.  Flashes of spirit aside, she is unable to think outside the context of his
experiences."
S1154: "  You might have spared your breath.  Irritated, you shrug and walk
away."
S1155: ""Are you going to be all right?"

"No," "
S1156: ""I'm not even sure I want to be all right."

"
S1157: "her"
S1158: ""You have nightmares?" you ask.

"I don't know what you would call them," she responds.  "I don't wake
screaming, the way he used to, when the moon was in a dark phase.  I don't cry
-- he drilled no ducts for tears.  But I am not alone in my mind; I hear him.""
S1159: ""No wonder," she says quietly.  "I still hear him screaming when I wake
up at night.  It is his ghost that screams at me.""
S1160: "You don't have anything to say on the matter.
"
S1161: "She knows of the artist's death.  To belabor it further would be the
height of cruelty.
"
S1162: ""No, don't touch me!"  She withdraws from your touch, turns away. 
"Don't touch me.""
S1163: ""There must be more you can tell me about the artist," you press her.

"
S1164: ""If you've any further curiosity on the topic, you'll have to ask
someone else.  Please -- just leave me alone now."

You nod and go.  She doesn't have the look of someone inclined to talk
further."
S1165: ""What is there to know?" she exclaims bitterly.  "What's left to say? 
He left me here!  What use am I without him?  I make no sense to anyone but
him...""
S1166: "

She shoots a sudden, unfriendly look your way.  "
S1167: ""Except, of course, that people like you will come stare and prod at me
as though I were produce at a market.  Oh, God, that I had never come awake at
all.  What use is there in this?  And you, you just stand there watching me as
though I were a spectacle made for your amusement and all my grief were only
art and posture.""
S1168: ""Tell me what you do know about him," you prompt.  "
S1169: "(Not that you have much admiration for the man, from what you can guess
of him.  But you're looking for some kind of explanation, a hint of what
underlay that bitterness.)"
S1170: "

"He hated people -- though I think he was also quite lonely.  It was a question
of not having patience for anyone."  "
S1171: ""If anyone tried to come up to the studio he'd get out his shotgun and
fire into the air until they got the idea.  The woman didn't even bring milk if
she knew he was there.  They had a system of leaving things for each other so
that they didn't have to meet.  And when he sold me, it was the same.  He wrote
letters, made arrangements; did not even stay with me, when they came to look
me over.""
S1172: ".  "Or who, or what, for that matter.  He sold me immediately after my
waking.  While he was carving me, there was no strangeness, but afterward...""
S1173: ""Ah -- by the way," she says, in a way that utterly fails to be casual,
"have you seen the artist out there?  -- "
S1174: "My"
S1175: ""No," you respond, uneasy.  You open your mouth and close it again."
S1176: ""No, I don't think so.  What does your artist look like?"

"
S1177: ""Black hair," she says, and stops...  "Never mind.  He's not here.  He
wouldn't have come.""
S1178: "You've never run into this artist before, but it doesn't seem (from the
maturity of the work) that this could be his first public piece."
S1179: ""He did reliefs?" you say.  "What was the subject matter, or do you
know?"

She shrugs.  "No idea.""
S1180: ""Do you happen to know anything about the other work that your artist
did -- besides yourself, I mean?"

"I know that he did some relief carving once on a commission, but that's the
only specific project I know anything about, and even then, I don't have any
details.  Obviously he must have done a fair amount of other work, but he never
discussed it.  Either it didn't live up to his standards, or he didn't think I
would be interested.""
S1181: ""I don't know much about the rest of his career, what he did before he
carved me," she continues after a moment.

"
S1182: ""I do know that he had been commissioned to do some reliefs at one
point, but that's about it.  Mostly he talked about his travels, his childhood,
stories he knew -- personal things.  So if you're curious about him as an
artist, you'll have to ask the gallery owners for a biography of some kind.""
S1183: "She shrugs, apparently not understanding what you're referring to."
S1184: ""Strangeness?  What sort of strangeness?"

"
S1185: ""You said it was strange, after you woke up," you prompt.

"
S1186: ""He avoided me.  He was uncomfortable; he wouldn't meet my eye.  He
wouldn't speak to me.  I asked him questions -- I had just discovered how to
speak, but for hours I thought I was getting it wrong, since he gave no sign...
 Finally I made him talk to me, and he told me that he didn't want me to be
alive.  He hadn't made me to be alive.  He asked me, in fact, if I would go
back to being a statue."

"
S1187: ""I said no.  I didn't think it would help.  And he sent me away.  He
didn't want me to be near him, if I couldn't be the way he had made me.""
S1188: ""He didn't want me to be awake, you see.  He didn't make me to be a "
S1189: "live"
S1190: " person.  He told me he wanted something that belonged to him, and that
if I could think and talk, I couldn't belong to him any more.  So he threw me
away."

"
S1191: "Her voice drops again.  "If I hadn't tried to reach him, if I hadn't
forced on him a comfort he didn't want...""
S1192: "You look at her, wondering about the other side of this story.  Had it
driven the artist mad, that she had come alive?  And what part of it was it
that had bothered him -- the sheer lack of logical sense, or the fact that
suddenly what had been a mute witness to his most personal grief was now aware,
able to judge, and to speak?"
S1193: "(It's all in the delivery; hers is not bad.  Too bad about the
artist.)"
S1194: "(And would she say that if she knew what is written on the placard?  Or
would she understand that he was troubled, at the end?)"
S1195: "She sketches a little gesture of futility, so elegant, so planned, that
you remember that she is a made thing, full of postures.  (And who is to say
that she wasn't taught that movement, and the rawness in her voice?)"
S1196: "She makes a quick gesture of futility, half-conscious but graceful."
S1197: ""What else?" you ask gently.  "Tell me more about him."

"
S1198: ""There were days when he didn't work at all: he would walk around the
studio talking to himself, to me.  Throwing things at the wall.  Fits, he
called them.""
S1199: "

Her voice drops a bit.  "When it got bad, he put a sheet over my head, turn me
towards the wall so that I couldn't see what was going on.  Once he went as far
as to wrap a cloth around my ears, though I could still hear him.  Moving
around and screaming."
"
S1200: ""He used to talk to me while he worked.  Not realizing, I think, that I
could hear, he told me things he would never have told to anyone else.""
S1201: ""Did he ever say-- or could you tell -- what it was that was upsetting
him so much?""
S1202: "  (This piece is starting to remind you of Gloria del Tredici's
"Victim" -- focusing attention off the animate, onto some hypothetical
background figure.)

"
S1203: ""No, he didn't say.  He told me things about his work, about his
childhood -- some secrets of a sort -- but whatever drove his nightmares and
made him mad, whatever made him careless with the chisel and furious..."

Whatever it was, it had to do with her; creation and destruction were sides of
the same coin."
S1204: ""He told me only a little," she says.  "It was all about hell and being
dead.  He was walking back and forth, but he had no body, and everything was
dark, and everyone else was in the same situation, not recognizing each other,
not able to speak.  Shades without voices.""
S1205: ""He believed in a hell like that?" you ask.  "Why?""
S1206: ""What sort of hell was it that he believed in?""
S1207: ""It went with his conception of the gods, I suppose," "
S1208: ".  "He read me a piece from the Odyssey once -- where Odysseus is about
to sacrifice the black animals so that he can speak with Teiresias the prophet
-- and his own mother doesn't recognize him...  It was a symbol for him.  He
was lonely."

(Aren't we all?)"
S1209: ""What about you?  Do you believe in shades like that?"

"
S1210: ""You actually believe in ghosts?"  "
S1211: ""I suppose I don't believe he's gone, leaving nothing at all behind.  I
don't know what that tells you.""
S1212: ""I don't know enough to believe one thing or another," "
S1213: ".  "I've been told that some people find the idea of an afterlife
comforting, and the opposite quite depressing -- and that this is the reason
that some people seek religion.  On the other hand, nothing that he believed
about the afterlife seemed to give any comfort at all.  So...""
S1214: "Even if the circumstances weren't so peculiar, you're not the kind who
confides in someone on an evening's acquaintance."
S1215: ""But he told you things that were personal."

"
S1216: ""So -- what did he tell you that was private?"

"
S1217: ""He didn't tell me enough to make me understand "
S1218: "this"
S1219: ""Perhaps I have no right to say so," she continues.  "But I suffered
for him.  I suffered being carved"
S1220: "; I grieved for him more than for myself.  But he couldn't do the same
for me.  Whatever he was enduring, he damn well owed me that: to stay at least
a little longer.""
S1221: "When she continues, it's in a voice so low you can't be sure you're
hearing right: "Perhaps his choice makes sense anyway."

She stretches out her hands, the fingers spread, and you notice that there is
no webbing between the thumb and the rest of the hand.  The light from above
gleams on her frosty skin.

"
S1222: ""Oh -- things about growing up.  How he felt uncomfortable and left
out, and didn't get along with the other children.  He used to pretend that he
was the god Dionysus in disguise.  Do you know the story of Dionysus and
Pentheus? or Dionysus with the pirates?"

She chuckles; a low sound that sets your neck prickling.  "He always wins. 
Taking a terrible revenge on those who do not recognize him.""
S1223: "

"All over Europe and America, certainly, though I think he might have gotten
other places than that.  The way he described it, he was looking for something.
 He liked to go to museums -- which isn't really surprising, I suppose -- but
that wasn't what he was trying to find.  And he liked talking to strangers, but
I don't think that was what he was looking for either.  Maybe a sensation, a
kind of numen -- certainly there were some memories that he kept coming back
to, that he cared about, that stood out in his mind.""
S1224: ""I think it bothered him," she says.  "
S1225: "

Just when you're about to ask what she means, she goes on.  "There were so many
bits of his life no one knew about at all.  Not important things, necessarily,
but isolating.  Some days after lunch he'd sit on his bed in the studio with a
glass of wine in his hand and reminisce.  He had a very visual memory -- not
surprising, considering what he was --"

"
S1226: "Her mood snaps suddenly.  "And now all those memories are spilled and
wasted, and I'm the only one who knows even a part of them.""
S1227: ""I remember those things as though I'd seen them myself; more clearly
than some of the things that I have seen.  I remember "
S1228: "standing on the deck of a night ferry from Piraeus while the light
faded over Athens.  Gypsies bedding down in the corridors. Americans drinking
Nescafe frappes and laughing.  The moon rising, yellow and distorted, and the
neon lights from the harborfront scattered on the water.""
S1229: "standing on a concrete tower, somewhere in the American West, up in the
mountains, watching a lightning storm come up from the valley, while there was
still fog behind me, on the peak.  There were two other people there -- people
I knew, but that night they seemed like strangers, as though we had all fallen
into myth, and any familiar face might be a disguise for a god.""
S1230: "crossing the Tiber at dusk, on a bridge lined with Bernini angels; in
the distance the birds ducking and swooping, gathering and dispersing like
smoke over the Capitoline.  But there were no augurs left in Rome to understand
the message.""
S1231: "She falls silent and thoughtful, and then after a moment she goes on to
other anecdotes: plotless, rambling, visions rather than events.  And you have
a sense of overwhelming strangeness -- most of all when she speaks of places
that are familiar to you, of Pygmalion's adventures in your own country. 
Everything was a portent or an omen to him."
S1232: "The effect stays with you for days, for weeks.  Things catch your eye. 
Windows watch you, doors fly open of their own accord, trash arranges itself
into inscrutable sigils.  Winds trouble you.  Trees stretch and touch your
shoulder as you pass, but when you turn your head, they have nothing to say. 
And night by night you wake, tangled, with the moon on your face."
S1233: ""Where was this night ferry going?" you ask."
S1234: ""You said he was on a night ferry once -- where was he going?""
S1235: "

"Crete.  It took all night and arrived in Heraklion in the early morning, just
when the markets were beginning.  Fish glimmering wet in the pale light, and
fruit, and sometimes meat."  "
S1236: "There's a wistful note in her voice.  Something lost.  "I'd almost
forgotten that part of the story," she goes on, very quietly.  "And I
shouldn't, because it is important, because it's there that he--""
S1237: ""You were telling me a story about Pygmalion on a night ferry, and neon
lights on the water?  "
S1238: "That doesn't sound very picturesque, somehow.  More sort of --
tawdry.""
S1239: ""He liked the collision of types.  The sublime and the sordid.  What he
didn't like was ordinariness, boredom, lack of imagination.""
S1240: ""Yes?" you prompt.

She rubs her face with her hand.  "Never mind.  No one cares but me."  She goes
so still that you're almost afraid that there's something wrong with her.  But
her pose is perfect, the head bent, the hand raised in grief: an ancient grave
marker brought to life.  This is what she was made for.  To be his monument. 
It seems to you that he planned this from the beginning, that she was
incomplete until she wept.

"
S1241: ""Don't," you say, your voice sounding unexpectedly harsh in your own
ears.  "You don't owe him that."

"
S1242: "Still she doesn't move, until you reach out and touch her shoulder. 
"No," you say.  "I don't know what you're thinking of doing, but "
S1243: "don't"
S1244: "."

She takes her hand away at last and looks at you, her eyes full of tears.

For a long time you hold her, making shush-shush noises as though you were
calming an infant."
S1245: "The light falls over her, perfect, cool.

You turn away."
S1246: ""Tell me about the Gypsies he met."

"Oh, he didn't really talk to them," she says.  "People generally didn't -- and
he generally didn't talk to anyone.  Mostly I think he felt a certain affinity
for them, lonely, private, and disliked, knowing a secret language and seeing
unseeable things."

"
S1247: ""So there were tourists on the night ferry?"

"Certainly.  Standing around on the front of the boat, talking very loudly and
apparently under the impression that no one else could understand what they
were saying."  She adds, "He didn't resent them because they were tourists.  He
was traveling too, after all.  But I think it bothered him how little they
listened and how much they talked."

"
S1248: ""Athens is quite polluted.  Or was, when he was there.  The air quality
was damaging all the ancient buildings, melting the marble.  "
S1249: "Rather a disturbing thought, for me."  "
S1250: "Don't worry," she says, observing your silence.

"
S1251: "A darkness passes over the skin of her face, dripping and smearing,
turning her eyes opaque, obliterating the clean lines of nose and chin.  And
then it is gone.

"
S1252: "She stretches out one hand, and for a moment her lily fingers go dull
and black, the detail softened, the polish lost.

"
S1253: "You frown; her look is unreadable, her eyes in shadow."
S1254: ""I'm not dangerous to you."  She gives you a look that seems almost
pitying.  "Except perhaps to your sanity.  But you seem hardy enough."

"But that doesn't explain anything," you complain.  She is silent, apparently
reluctant.

"
S1255: ""Are you made of some kind of new material?" you demand, casting about.
 "Somehow become self-aware?  A shape-shifter?"

"
S1256: "She laughs.  "That's a closer explanation than any other that you are
likely to come up with," she says.  "And if you're willing to entertain the
notion--"

"
S1257: "You aren't, of course, not really, but it's too late to tell her that
now, too late to cram reality back into its box.  With a laugh like that of a
child being let outside, she turns -- to wood, the color and style of a product
of Old Kingdom Egypt.  To glass, faceted, her hair scattering the downshot
light to a thousand tiny points.  To a sculpture of sand, to a pillar of salt,
to flowing water, to flame.

"
S1258: "And finally her substance has fled entirely, and she is only a shadow,
passing around you in a cool whisper.

"I am what you think I am; I am what your treatment makes of me.""
S1259: ""Why was he on a tower in the mountains?" you ask."
S1260: ""You were telling me about a night he spent in the mountains?  On some
kind of tower?""
S1261: "

"Yes.  Watching the storm, wondering whether it would reach his camp or not. 
It was coming closer and closer, and might have become dangerous, eventually. 
Though he sounded, when he told me the story, as though he would have welcomed
the danger.  He wasn't afraid of physical things as much as he was of
blindness, banality, ordinariness.""
S1262: "

You can't help making a little face at this pronouncement.  "What?  What are
you thinking?"

You tilt your head, meet her gaze frankly.  "I'm thinking that it's a typical
attitude," you say.  "A certain amount of real vision and brilliance combined
with a sense of superiority and a horror of anything that would make him like
other people.  And no sense of humor."

She opens her mouth angrily.

"
S1263: ""Did you ever hear him laugh?" you interrupt.  "A real laugh about
something that was funny.  Not a dark brooding cynical laugh about the hard
life that the fates had given him."

"No."

You nod.  "There's something to be said for ordinary.  Sometimes.  You can't
live forever on mountaintops."

"
S1264: ""You should have been his friend rather than me," she says, after a
long time.  "Perhaps you could have helped him more."

"I doubt it.  He may have eschewed blindness, but it sounds as though he was a
bit deaf to what other people had to say.  Including you."

You hold her gaze for a long time, until you're sure she understands what you
are telling her."
S1265: ""What companions were those?" you ask."
S1266: ""You told me about how he stood in the mountains once with friends --
who were they?""
S1267: "

"He didn't tell me," she replies, wondering.  "And now that you mention it, it
seems strange.  He seldom had friends of any kind, he could barely stand
people; who they were, where they came from-- I don't know.""
S1268: "There's a wistful note in her voice.  Something lost.  "And I should
have asked, and now--""
S1269: "

After a moment she shakes her head.  "I'm not sure he thought it was important,
himself.  The moment usually meant more to him than the people in it.""
S1270: ""Do the gods disguise themselves often?" you ask, puzzled.

"Oh, yes," "
S1271: ""To test people; to try their virtue; to guide them, or to betray them.
 Dionysus most of all, I think, though that might be only the stories that he
told me.""
S1272: ""What bridge was that?" you ask softly, not wanting to disturb the mood
she's fallen into.

"
S1273: ""So which bridge on the Tiber was this, that Pygmalion told you about?"
 "
S1274: ""I don't know," she says.  "There was a huge round building,
crenellated like a castle, at one end, and I-- he-- was walking away from it. 
What he mostly noticed were the birds, and this sense of something happening,
beyond human comprehension.""
S1275: "It sounds as though the artist was not a very happy person, but, in
fact, rather ill-socialized."
S1276: ""So essentially he wanted people around in general but he was too picky
to like any particular people?"

"It's a little more complicated than that.  There were other factors."  She
pauses thoughtfully.  "Pride.  Total absorption in what he was working on. 
This kind of focus that made it hard for him even to acknowledge that there was
someone else in the room sometimes.  If he was thinking about something, he was
thinking, and he didn't want to be interrupted.""
S1277: ""Forgive me," you say, "but you don't even sound at the moment as
though you liked him very much."

"Like and love are different things," she replies.  "You must know that.  And
then -- he had a kind of intensity that compelled, that was absolute.  I've not
met anyone else like that.  Yes, it's true that I haven't met very many people
yet in my life, but my suspicion is, from all I see and hear, that he was
unusual in that regard.  There was something eating him from the inside, all
the time, and the energy of it was contagious."

"
S1278: ""Most people don't have that kind of genius, but most people also
aren't so impossible to live with."

She makes a face.  "I think I'm accustomed to being a little unhappy.  I prefer
it to lowering my expectations."

"Like him."

"Yes."

"
S1279: "You are both silent.  There seems no more to say."
S1280: ""He didn't have any friends that you know of?"

"Not very many people lived up to his standards, I think.  He had very little
tolerance for ignorance or superstition or -- well, he had very little
tolerance.  Perhaps part of his artistic temperament.""
S1281: ""I think perhaps there was something a bit self-feeding about it," she
says reflectively.  "He was lonely, but at the same time no one lived up to his
standards.  So he'd spend a little time with someone, decide they were
inadequate, and push them away."  Her voice goes bitter.  "As, for instance, in
my case.""
S1282: ""You said there were memories that he cared about particularly -- what
sorts of things?"

"
S1283: ""Like the one I told you," she says.  "
S1284: ""There were moments where I think he felt he could see through to
another existence entirely."

(That de Chirico quote, about there being another, metaphysical existence
behind ordinary objects: do all artists feel that way?)

"For all that he was lonely, I don't think that other people usually mattered
to him terribly much.  What he was trying to work out was between himself and
the universe -- or universal forces, or the gods, or something -- and
everything else was just..."  She shrugs."
S1285: ""Does it bother you, being left with these memories of his?""
S1286: "  When she doesn't answer, you add, "At least you've got a piece of him
that would have been lost, otherwise."

"
S1287: ""I suppose that ought to be consolation of a sort."

You're both silent."
S1288: "

"I wish I had my own, I suppose.  My history is so short; if I consulted only
what I know myself, I'd think there were only two or three rooms in the world. 
Though at the moment it begins to feel more as though there were only "
S1289: "one."
S1290: "

(You have a brief, anarchist image of taking her away with you: inviting her to
step off the pedestal and stroll out through the main room...)"
S1291: ""When he talked about the past, what did he say?  Or was he specific?"

"
S1292: ""Lots of people feel alienated during childhood.  Especially
intelligent and creative people who don't think in quite the same terms as
everyone else.  That's no deep secret -- people talk about that sort of thing
all the time."

(All the time?  Well.  A rhetorical exaggeration, not a lie.)

"
S1293: "A faint flush creeps into her cheek.  "
S1294: ""Perhaps," she says, "I don't have the experience to know what's
extraordinary.  Perhaps ordinary people exchange such information readily. 
Perhaps his trust of me was nothing."

"
S1295: "You're so used to the conventions of this medium -- recognizing a
set-scene when it comes -- that you expect her to go on.  You could almost
write the rest of the monologue yourself: Perhaps his trust was nothing, but it
was all she had, etc.

Instead she's silent.  And you realize abruptly and with certainty that she's
no machine."
S1296: ""Doubtless you're a better judge of that than I," you respond, after a
dragging moment during which you expect her to go on, and she doesn't.  It's
getting more and more difficult to be rude to her; civilized social habits have
taken over.  "If it seemed significant to you, it probably was.""
S1297: ""What was his childhood like?" you ask.

"
S1298: "  "Like I said, he didn't get along with his father, and his mother was
out of the picture.  "
S1299: "  "His mother died when he was very young, and his father was not a
kind man.  Too little money and too little sympathy.  "
S1300: "As soon as he was old enough, he started to travel around -- when he
was only fifteen or sixteen, I think.  Visiting people he knew at first, but
when that didn't work out, going farther afield.""
S1301: ""What else do you know about his parents?"

"I really don't know much more than I've told you.  He didn't like talking
about his father, and he didn't know much about his mother -- barely remembered
her.""
S1302: ""Do you know anything about his parents, where he came from?"

"He didn't talk about them much," she says.  "His mother died when he was
young, and he didn't get along with his father.""
S1303: ""There are four sorts of madness that the gods send," she says.  "The
madness of drink -- that's from Dionysus.  The madness of prophecy, which is of
Apollo.  The madness of love, which comes from Aphrodite.  And the madness of
creation, which is the inspiration of the Muses."  "
S1304: ""Those whom the gods wish to destroy..." she adds softly."
S1305: ""To the best of my knowledge he did not have a drinking problem.""
S1306: ""What about love affairs?  Was he driven crazy with love?"

"
S1307: ""If you mean, was he in love with anyone that I saw, no."  "
S1308: ""Like I said, I think he was once in love with that woman in
Navplion.""
S1309: ""Possibly he loved that woman in Navplion.""
S1310: ""There might have been someone in the past, who... well.  He never told
me in so many words.  But at times he seemed troubled.""
S1311: ""So did you ever see him drunk at all?"

"Maybe three or four times," she admits.  "To be honest, he was usually happier
then.  Sang songs, relaxed a bit.  For a while.  The mornings after were bad,
though.""
S1312: ""Did Pygmalion drink too much, then?"

"
S1313: ""He drank often, but not to excess," she replies.  "His darker fits
didn't come from being drunk; they were just the results of his moods.""
S1314: ""So what did Pygmalion talk to you about?"

"
S1315: ""He talked to you?" you prompt.  "What did he say?"

"Whatever came into his mind.  About his childhood, about growing up.  About
the world.  He'd travelled a lot, seen a lot of different things, met people
everywhere.  I can't remember all the stories that he told me, but there were
many.

"And he talked about the old gods, and all the forms of madness that they send.
 Some of them he called friends, but most were his enemies."

"
S1316: ""Which may just have been his way of telling me things that I would not
otherwise have been able to understand.  Or that he could not otherwise have
stood to say.""
S1317: ""It was always full of sunshine," "
S1318: ".  "The windows were open day and night, and the breeze came from the
shore.  The first thing that I saw, when I began to see, was the ocean off
beneath us.""
S1319: ""He had a studio in Cyprus," she continues, dropping one line of
thought and picking up another.  "That's where I was born -- he brought the
marble for me there and carved me.""
S1320: ""How did you eat?  Did he keep a garden?"  "
S1321: ""Kept would be too strong a word.  There was an area beside the studio
which contained plants, and which received light," "
S1322: ""It grew more or less at will.  A few vegetables, a few flowers, a lot
of wild things that weren't invited.  Not much good for food, but it certainly
smelled good on a warm evening.""
S1323: "She says she's never eaten anything.  A shame."
S1324: "You think briefly about the spread in the other room -- crackers,
champagne, pickled mushrooms, ten kinds of exotic cheese..."
S1325: "You don't have anything particular to say on the subject."
S1326: ""It's not entirely awful being human," you point out.  "
S1327: ""Eating can be quite pleasant.  A nice loaf of fresh bread, or a good
cheese...  It would be foolish to let too fastidious an aesthetic sense stand
in the way of your trying it.""
S1328: "Her shoulder hunches, a nonverbal rejection of what you're saying.  "
S1329: "(Another point for your review: gestural communication very refined...)
 "
S1330: "

Oh well.  No point in pursuing it, really."
S1331: "Not much left to say on the subject, is there?"
S1332: ""Wouldn't you like to try eating sometime?"

"
S1333: "You're surprised by the flicker of apprehension in her eyes.  (You'd
think you were offering her the apple -- what does that make you, the vile
seducer?  Silly thought.)  "
S1334: ""I don't know," she says slowly.  "I'm afraid it would make me
dependent; that if I began--"

"You'd be mortal like the rest of us," you finish.  "
S1335: ""So much for your vaunted desire to be able to die."  "
S1336: "

"That I'd feel pain more deeply," she corrects.  "That I wouldn't be able to
escape; that it would all be more, and worse.  I saw how he suffered.  Who
could blame me for not wanting the same?""
S1337: ""Have you ever tried eating anything?"

"It's cheaper for the gallery owners if I don't."  "
S1338: "As reasonable an explanation as any, you suppose."
S1339: "

"Of course," you say.  "But have you?"

She shakes her head."
S1340: ""Do you -- eat, at all?" you ask.

"I don't need to," she replies.  "Just as I don't need to breathe -- though I
find it calming to do so.  I feel better that way.  Besides, I find that people
notice if I don't breathe and it makes them nervous, though they don't realize
that that's what it is that's bothering them.""
S1341: "The air conditioner chooses this moment to blast you with cold air.

"
S1342: ""Okay," she says.  "Where's some food?  You have any?"

"
S1343: ""What?  No, not -- not with me.  There's some in the other room, if you
like."

"
S1344: "You watch in confusion and disbelief as she hops off the pedestal.  "
S1345: "Bemused, you follow her into the other room, where (disregarding the
stares of everyone around her) she helps herself to two handfuls of crackers, a
whole wedge of Stilton, and enough caviar to recolonize the Dead Sea.

"
S1346: "Her bravado wears off a little when it comes to actually eating the
stuff, and she carries her plate back into the other room and sits consciously
on the pedestal.  "So what do I do?"

"
S1347: ""Take something, put it in your mouth.  Chew.  Swallow."

She still looks confused, so you fix up one of the crackers.  "The Stilton's a
bit of an acquired taste--"  But she seems to be choking, so you skip the
monologue and hand her the bottled water you had the prescience to pick up.

"You okay?"

She swallows, with difficulty; looks at you teary-eyed; and says, "This is
AMAZING."

"
S1348: "She doesn't have any bodily functions -- unless you count battery
charging and circuit repair."
S1349: "It sounds as though she does sleep.  "
S1350: "It's not clear whether she eats.  "
S1351: "She can breathe, but doesn't have to.  "
S1352: "You have seen her breathe -- or do something that looked like
breathing.  "
S1353: "You haven't even seen her breathe."
S1354: "You don't have anything particular to say on the subject."
S1355: ""It's not entirely awful being human," you point out.  "
S1356: ""Eating can be quite pleasant.  A nice loaf of fresh bread, or a good
cheese...  It would be foolish to let too fastidious an aesthetic sense stand
in the way of your trying it.""
S1357: "Her shoulder hunches, a nonverbal rejection of what you're saying.  "
S1358: "(Another point for your review: gestural communication very refined...)
 "
S1359: "

Oh well.  No point in pursuing it, really."
S1360: "Evidently she's gone on thinking about your remarks, because after a
moment she says, "I've never even seen anything I wanted to eat.  It seems a
disgusting process, to be honest."

You regard her with amusement.  "Being human does involve certain disgusting
processes, of which eating is probably the least offensive."

"I still don't get it," she replies primly."
S1361: "You have more or less exhausted the subject, haven't you?"
S1362: ""What about wine?  You might like the taste," you say, feeling oddly
smug.  "And there'd be no danger of intoxication, surely."

"
S1363: "She meets your eye obliquely; her expression softens, and she tilts her
head a bit.  "
S1364: "She seems to be just discovering what it is to be teased.

"
S1365: "

(Extraordinary, that look: surprised, thoughtful, amused-- a swift progression
of half a dozen thoughts-- it's becoming impossible to think of her as 'just' a
machine.)

"
S1366: ""I don't think that I'd care for it," she remarks after a moment, her
tone speculative.  "Wet things are distasteful to me.""
S1367: "She glints at you.  "I don't think I'd care for it.  Wet things are
distasteful to me.""
S1368: "She just hunches a shoulder, indifferent."
S1369: ""Do you drink?"

"No, I don't drink any more than I eat," she replies, seeming a little vexed
that you can't guess as much."
S1370: ""You don't need to eat, so I presume you don't need to drink either?"

"Right," she says."
S1371: ""Do you ever drink?"

"No -- I don't need to eat or drink.""
S1372: ""What about this woman who brought the food to the studio?" you ask. 
"Did you ever talk to her?"

Galatea laughs, surprised.  "Of course not.   She would have been frightened
out of her senses.  She knew what I was -- well, she knew what I was supposed
to be, anyway.  Speaking to her would probably have sent her down to the church
to get me exorcised.""
S1373: ""I love the ocean," she says, "because it is the first thing beyond
myself and him that seemed alive.  I could see it through the windows of the
studio when he was carving me, and I thought, by the way the waves rose and
fell, that it breathed, as we did.""
S1374: ""It was a terrible disappointment," she remarks thoughtfully, "when I
first learned that the ocean is only water, slipping back and forth under the
command of the moon.  He used to tell me things like that, even before I asked:
I think he could perceive where I was looking, what I wanted to know.""
S1375: ""It's a huge rock in the sky," she remarks.  "Or so I'm told.  I've no
means of verifying that for myself, but then, there's almost nothing that I
know for myself, is there?""
S1376: ""I didn't see the moon until after I woke up and could move," she says.
 "It was never visible from where I stood.  I could see the light sometimes --
but I didn't know where it came from.  It seemed to come when he was asleep,
and when it did, he didn't have nightmares as much.  So I told myself stories
about the light, that it was sent by the gods to protect us."  She smiles
harshly.  "Nonsense, of course...""
S1377: ""So the tides disappoint you?" you ask.

"Disappoint?  Who am I to be disappointed?"  She shrugs, laughing a little
dryly.  "They're only one of a million things about which I was wrong.  So? 
The world is larger and less pretty than I thought. But I have no right to
complain about what is.""
S1378: "It doesn't sound wholly pleasant, being carved.  In fact, it sounds as
though it was both painful and frightening, a birth where the labor rested with
the child."
S1379: "You asked her about it once, but she brushed you off rather rudely. 
But perhaps if you tried again?"
S1380: "It would be interesting to know what it was like to be carved."
S1381: " you remember being carved?" you ask.

"
S1382: ""Better, I dare say, than you remember being born," she replies, her
voice low and mocking."
S1383: ""Very well," you say, brushing aside her smugness.  "What was it like,
then?"

"
S1384: ""What was it like, being sculpted?"

"
S1385: ""You haven't listened, have you?" she says.  "
S1386: ""It hurt... not beyond endurance, but in a way that was frightening.""
S1387: "She has her fears, she says, like anyone.  "
S1388: "The fear of pain, particularly; and it does not sound as if being
carved was necessarily COMFORTABLE."
S1389: "Does she have fears?  Or is she immune to that emotion?"
S1390: ""When you're afraid, what is it like?"

She laughs without mirth.  "What makes you think that it's any different for me
than it would be for you?  Or are you trying to pretend that you've never been
afraid?"

"
S1391: ""I thought it might be different for you because, as you say, you
aren't mortal.  So what is there to fear?"

"Pain," she replies.  "Which is what everyone fears, after all.""
S1392: ""It was just a question," you remark mildly."
S1393: ""Of course.  There are parts of being carved that were quite
frightening -- I never knew when the chisel might slip, or the drill.""
S1394: ""How could it have been painful to be carved?  He wasn't cutting into
you -- just around you."

"
S1395: ""The stone beyond the boundary of oneself is numb, but there always
comes a time when the chisel or the point reaches down to where feeling begins,
and strikes.  Likewise the drill -- and being polished left all my skin burning
and itching for days.""
S1396: ""You say you're afraid of pain, but what experience do you have of it? 
Did it really hurt to be carved?"

"Yes.  "
S1397: ""What do you know of pain?" you ask.  "Have you ever been hurt?  Can
you be?"

""
S1398: "I'm not sure I find that a reassuring question," she remarks dryly. 
"But y"
S1399: "The stone beyond the boundary of oneself is numb, but there always
comes a time when the chisel or the point reaches down to where feeling begins,
and strikes.  Likewise the drill -- and being polished left all my skin burning
and itching for days.""
S1400: "She starts speaking again after a moment, as though she's spent all
this time trying to think of the rest of her statement.  "When you're in the
rock," she begins, "you don't feel anything at first.  It seems safe.  You
can't move, but you don't want to.  The stone beyond you is numb...  But there
comes a time when the punch has cleared away most of the excess, when you begin
to feel the impact of each blow.  And when the chisel actually touches skin
somewhere, it's -- intrusive.  Quite unpleasant.""
S1401: "You frown a moment, trying to recollect the list she gave you: punch,
polish, chisel, claw, drill"
S1402: ".  None of them very gentle-sounding words..."
S1403: "You know virtually nothing about the tools involved in carving, just a
sketchy recollection of a picture of a sculptor, hammer in one hand and chisel
in the other."
S1404: ""I only know the punch and the polish, the chisel, the claw...  "
S1405: "You wouldn't imagine what it's like being carved, how long it takes and
how painful it is.  "
S1406: "  My eyes -- he drilled the corners of them in, and it took an
eternity.""
S1407: ""So, being polished--"

"Was excruciating.  It doesn't hurt at first, the way it it hurts being chipped
at -- but then it abrades, and begins to sting."

"
S1408: "  "If he hadn't talked to me while it was going on I think I would have
gone mad.  That's when I learned the most from him.  It was more effort working
with the point, or the chisel.  I don't know if you know this, but it takes a
lot of strength to hammer marble, and even more if it's unusually hard marble. 
But the polishing left him with more breath, to talk...""
S1409: ""Tell me about the pointing machine," you prompt.  "I don't think I've
seen one."

"Probably not.  It's a contraption of levers and points, and things that you
adjust by screws -- to tell the truth, I'm not sure myself how it works.  I saw
him using it, felt the fingers of it on my skin, knew it as the apparatus by
which he was working out his intentions for me.  But I never understood the
mechanics.""
S1410: ""What did the plaster model look like?"

"Why, like me!  Obviously."  Her voice dips deeper, thoughtful.  "Though of
course, one might wonder... if I woke up, why didn't she?  Why am I alive, when
she only stood there?  "
S1411: "I did think about it, and the only answer that I came to was this: she
felt no pain.  She was built, of plaster, and I don't think that could have
hurt, the way it hurts to be carved.""
S1412: ""How was she posed, though?"

"You mean, how was I posed?  Facing front, looking out, with my hands to the
sides and my weight on one foot.  There was -- she had an expression that I
have never seen on my own face, when I've come near a mirror.  A kind of... no,
I don't know what it was.  It makes my face stiff to go back to looking like
that.""
S1413: ""Did he make a model before he made you?" you ask.

"Oh, yes," she said.  "Though I didn't know, for the longest time, what she
was.  I could see her, but I didn't know that she was me.""
S1414: ""You make it sound as though you've tried your hand at carving
yourself," you remark.

"Yes -- after I woke up.  To amuse me, or perhaps to keep me quiet, he let me
try his tools on the marble.  I asked him for a piece that didn't have anyone
in it, just to be on the safe side.  I didn't think I had the skill to bring
someone out, you see, the way he'd done for me, and I didn't want to torture
anyone unnecessarily."

"And?"

"And so he gave me a couple of flat pieces he had left over from some reliefs
he'd been commissioned to do.  I did what I could with them -- but it wasn't
much.""
S1415: "She shrugs.  "The hammer is just a hammer.  Made of wood.  You use it
to hit the back of whatever tool you're driving."

After a moment, she adds, "He did tell me that there are artificial hammers
that somehow do the work for you.  But he didn't approve of sparing yourself
effort at the expense of the piece.  He said he wanted to be as accurate as
possible.""
S1416: ""What is a punch?" you ask.

"It's a pointed tool, like an ice pick.  The first tool for the roughest work
-- the surface of the block has to be broken before it can be shaped.""
S1417: ""What it sounds like," she says.  Her fingers curl in a savage,
startling shape, then loosen again.  "Like a rake, like several chisels tied
together.  It scrapes away the excess, until the sculptor begins to come down
to the level in which the detail begins.""
S1418: ""I'm sure there are books," she remarks.  "You've exhausted what I
know.  After all, the perspective of the object is seldom very useful.""
S1419: ""Then how would an expert describe it?"  You feel a little guilty,
pressing her like this.  But then there's something so conscious about the way
she holds herself, the way she draws you on.

"
S1420: ""The fine tool, after the punch and the claw, before the polish comes. 
The instrument by which the details are made, except for the deep holes that
take the drill.""
S1421: ""What is a chisel?" you ask.

She makes a hesitant gesture with her fingers, describing a flat blade at the
end of a long shaft -- and then her hand returns to its former pose.  "It
slides over you, taking away the excess, until it comes in contact with the
skin..."  "
S1422: "

"Though," she adds, after a pause.  "I'm sure that is not how an expert would
describe it.""
S1423: "A tool, and clearly not one she was fond of.  She speaks of pain, and
fear, and the corners of her eyes."
S1424: "A tool.  You've never touched one, yourself."
S1425: ""Tell me about the drill," you say.

"I can't," she answers, hesitant.  "Of all the tools he used, it was the only
one that made me afraid.  I trusted his skill with the others -- but when he
was putting the corners in my eyes, the spaces between my fingers, then I had
doubts.""
S1426: ""Having him drill the corners of my eyes -- being able to see the drill
each time when it came near -- the fact that it hurt, and that I was always
afraid he would go too deep -- and I couldn't close my eyelids, or flinch,
because I hadn't learned to move yet -- that frightened me.  It wasn't just the
pain, because there are other things about being carved that are not pleasant
either.  But I didn't trust him with the drill; I tried, but I couldn't make
myself trust him.""
S1427: ""Then you already existed inside the block?""
S1428: "  (A nice touch, a bow to Michelangelo.)"
S1429: "

"I existed from the time that he began searching for me," she says.  "Though I
don't remember the beginnings well, since I could neither see nor hear, and
none of me touched the open air.""
S1430: ""Are you really marble, then?  Because you seem --"

She shakes her head.  "I woke up," she says.  "For him, because he longed for
something so badly that I -- a block of stone -- began to have feelings.  But
now...  Now I don't want the gift."

"
S1431: ""What is it that makes a good marble?"

"
S1432: ""Absence of flaws, for a start," "
S1433: ".  "Streaks of mica in the stone, any inclusions at all, can make your
piece crack suddenly when you're working on it.  Then there's fineness of
grain, and color.  You don't want too much color variation, and large-grained
stone doesn't take detail well."

"
S1434: ""Go on," you say.

"Then there's also general workability.  Thasos marble is very difficult to
work -- many sculptors wouldn't touch it, especially not with the old-fashioned
tools used on me.  But..."  She shrugs, as though the advantages are
self-evident."
S1435: ""I come from Thasos," she says.

"
S1436: ""The marble in the quarries there is some of the best: enduring, hard. 
Slow to carve, and slow to wear away.""
S1437: "Damned unnerving, actually, the way her skin changed texture suddenly
and at her whim."
S1438: ""What ARE you?" you demand.  "How can you make your skin sparkle, and
your shape change, and then change back?"

"
S1439: "Even as she says it, for a moment, "
S1440: "a million tiny crystals sparkle in her skin.  "
S1441: "you sense something odd about her skin: it seems to sparkle as though
it were made of millions of tiny crystals.  "
S1442: "(An unusual and evocative effect; you haven't seen stone effects in
skin since VanItallie's gargoyle series, about ten years ago.  But then, the
Grotesque school is pretty well dead at this point.)

"
S1443: "She's told you about the quarries on Thasos where her marble comes from
-- down by the shore, washed by the sea."
S1444: "It's not something you know much about."
S1445: ""Have you ever actually been to a quarry?" you ask.

"
S1446: ""But he told me about them so often that I feel as though I have been
-- most of my memories are really his.  In any case: he used to go down there
and watch the blocks being cut.  And he'd also visited some of the ancient
quarries in Attica, where you can see the round holes -- they were cutting
column drums, and they took out round pieces rather than cutting blocks and
rounding them later.  More efficient that way.""
S1447: ""He used to tell me stories about the quarries on Thasos.  The island
is marble right down to the shoreline, and the sea washes into the old
cuttings.  So I began there at the edge of the saltwater; they cut the block
for me and set me on a ship and sent me to Cyprus."

Her voice is wistful as the story ends.  "And now, I wish that ship had sunk,
and taken me to the bottom of the Mediterranean before his punch ever touched
the block.""
S1448: ""It's an island off the Chersonese.  Settled long ago, with the
sanctuaries of the old gods still on it."

"
S1449: ""I don't remember it," she adds, as an afterthought.  "But he used to
tell me about it.""
S1450: "her"
S1451: ""When did you first begin to see?" you ask.  "Was it when your eyes
were finished, or could you somehow see before that?""
S1452: "  (Can she still see through her skin?  Hideous thought.)"
S1453: "

"Before that," she says.  "Certainly before he began to drill in the corners. 
It was a gradual thing: everything was dim and shadowed, and it grew brighter
and sharper the closer he came to the surface of my eyes, until I could
recognize colors, and know his face.""
S1454: ""Have you always been able to hear?""
S1455: "

"As long as I can remember, yes.  Though what I heard first was only his voice,
and I didn't learn to recognize other sounds until later."  "
S1456: ""Have you a sense of taste?"

"I don't know," she says.  "I assume so.""
S1457: "

"Then you don't need to eat?" you ask.

"No.  Don't need to, never have.""
S1458: "

"Then you not only don't need to eat, but you've never even tried it?"

"That's right," "
S1459: ""So you do have a sense of smell, too."

"Certainly," she says.  "Whichever god woke me from the stone was thorough.""
S1460: ""Can you smell?  Or is your nose purely--"

"Decorative?  No, I have a sense of smell.""
S1461: ""When did you first start to be able to speak?" you ask."
S1462: "

"I've always understood words; they were the first things I knew of."  "
S1463: ""But actually to speak -- not until I woke up.""
S1464: "According to her, she understands every word Pygmalion ever spoke to
her, and can use them all."
S1465: "She has a fairly idiosyncratic vocabulary -- lots of specialized words
not in the standardly available starter databases.  And then there's the
question of diction, which is also nonstandard and shows evidence of
considerable retooling.  Now that you think about it, that probably took at
least as much time and effort as the body mechanics."
S1466: ""You say you have a limited vocabulary, but you seem to me to know a
fair number of words."

"
S1467: ""Yes," she says after a moment.  "But "
S1468: "I only know the words that I heard him say.  I always understood his
speech.  There are some things, though, that he never talked about -- that I
have seen or thought of for myself -- and for those I have no words.""
S1469: "Her diction patterns show evidence of considerable retooling from the
standard.  There are certain traditional ways of programming a piece so that
its speech reflects a specific regional dialect or social class (which
obviously wouldn't be so appropriate here, class-less and background-free as
she is), and also to convey emotion.  Some of the things she says are quite
idiosycratic, though -- a sign either that some effort went into a systematic
redesign, or that some of her speeches were written verbatim by the artist."
S1470: ""Do you know how to read?" you ask.

"A bit," "
S1471: ""I still have to say the words aloud sometimes, in order to get the
sense out of them.""
S1472: "  Or did you teach yourself, the way you taught yourself to breathe?"
S1473: ""I don't have to," she says, "in the sense of getting tired...  I'm not
sure what tired feels like, actually.  But there are times when I can't think
any more, don't want to see anything else, and oblivion sounds greatly
preferable.""
S1474: ""So do you sleep?"

"Yes.  Or at least, there are times when I cease to pay attention to what is
around me, when my mind wanders...  I can't see myself from the outside, so I
don't know whether it looks like sleeping as other people do it.""
S1475: ""So you don't need to breathe at all?" you ask.  "Or do you?""
S1476: "

"I don't have to.  I --"  She laughs a little self-consciously.  "Actually, I
taught myself how, watching him.  I noticed that he did it, and I decided that
I should figure out how it worked.  Once I began I found it soothing.  But not
necessary.""
S1477: ""Have others --"

"You're the first to come around the corner," she says, before you have a
chance to finish the thought.  "But the gallery owners told me what I could
expect.  To be stared at; to be spoken of as though I weren't present.""
S1478: ""You --"  You pause, not quite certain where to go with this question. 
"
S1479: ""You know that you're here to be looked at, then."

"I don't mind being seen.  But I was made to be viewed by -- by one person
only.  Not by hordes of strangers.""
S1480: ""What do you believe?" she asks suddenly.  "Do you worship fat men in
suits?"

You stifle the inclination to laugh.  "I'm not on the side of the
Establishment, if that's what you mean."  (Which of course it isn't.  But you
don't care to answer the question on her terms.)"
S1481: "She sighs, exasperated.  "You wouldn't ignore me if I weren't standing
on this pedestal.""
S1482: ""You might try speaking to me," she prompts.  "It's not polite merely
to "
S1483: "  And I've gotten very bored, standing here."

(An attempt to engage the audience -- the proactive element...  you frame the
words for your review, but you find that you can't get as far as a complete
first sentence.  There's something more here; anxious, chilly, visceral. 
Better pay attention.)"
S1484: ""You're bored?"

"Wouldn't you be?  Standing here all evening, with no one to talk to and
nothing to do?"  "
S1485: ""Asking me that over and over is certainly boring," she replies
wearily.  "I think on the whole I almost prefer being ignored.""
S1486: ""Let's say, rather, that you're not relieving my boredom.""
S1487: ""I'm not bored," she replies.  "Though that might be preferable.""
S1488: ""Not at all," she replies, sounding surprised."
S1489: ""But you really have to stop asking me that," she adds."
S1490: ""You seem awfully concerned about what kind of impression you're
making," she adds, a bit archly."
S1491: ""Don't worry about it, though," she adds.  "Not everyone can be
entertaining all the time.  Right?"

You stare at her mutely, "
S1492: "wondering whether her rudeness is intentional or just a design flaw in
the protocol package."
S1493: "wondering whether she means to be rude."
S1494: ""There's no need to be self-conscious," she adds helpfully."
S1495: "She glances at you thoughtfully for a moment, then turns back to her
previous pose."
S1496: "She rubs her forehead with one hand.  "I'm sorry," she says.  "This
conversation is confusing me.  I must be tired -- or -- I don't know.""
S1497: ""All right, may I ask you something?" she asks.

"
S1498: ""WAS there any connection between your last remark and what we were
talking about before?"

"
S1499: ""Uh -- no.  Sorry about that."

"Just checking.""
S1500: ""Ah... They're both vaguely related to "
S1501: ""I have to say," she remarks after a moment, "sometimes I don't quite
understand how other people's minds work.  The connections between things...""
S1502: "

Which is a very unusual remark for her kind to make, you reflect, looking at
her closely."
S1503: "

"I often surprise even myself," you reply lightly."
S1504: "There's a long, dragging silence.  "
S1505: "  "You're not saying anything.  Did I say something I shouldn't have?"

"Not at all," you respond.  "I just thought you might have something more to
add.  And I suppose I was thinking.""
S1506: ""Okay," she says, after another long pause.  She laughs a little
self-consciously.  "I'm still not any good at telling, a lot of the time, what
people are getting at.  Direct questions where a person wants information,
okay.  Instructions, even if they annoy me.  Direct statements intended to give
me information.  But then there are these whole categories of things that
people say because they want you to understand something else which they aren't
saying and which it wouldn't be appropriate to say in so many words..."

"
S1507: ""Not an uncommon problem.  Some people go their whole lives without
developing any social perception, or anything like tact.  Not to mention that
what one person thinks is an obvious cue may be an utter enigma to someone
else.""
S1508: "Well, naturally.  Social perception is more or less impossible to
program into a machine.  Though, come to that, the fact that she knows enough
to make such a disclaimer is... odd.  You find yourself frowning at her
thoughtfully."
S1509: "her"
S1510: ""This is silly," she says after a moment.  "I shouldn't be treating you
that way -- I know that, you're a guest of the gallery, a patron, one of the
people to whom I'm supposed to be polite.  But please-- please go.  I can't
play the role they asked of me.  I would never have consented if I'd known what
it would be like."

There's nothing left to say.  As you turn down the hall, you have one last
glimpse of her, her face shadowed and pensive."
S1511: ""I'm sorry," she says.  "You've deserved better from me than that.  But
then, I haven't had much guidance in how to conceal strong emotion," she adds,
with a flick of humor."
S1512: "It sounds as though she was standing more or less as she is now."
S1513: "It would be interesting to know how she was posed before she could
move."
S1514: ""How were you originally posed?" you ask.  "Before you could move, that
is?"

"
S1515: ""Much like this," she says.  She lifts her head a little: her eyes meet
yours, a kind of fixity comes into her expression; there is a new pride there,
an aloofness.

"Like that," she says, breaking the mask, becoming natural again.  "It is too
stiff for me to hold for long.""
S1516: ""I -- was facing out.  Looking at him as he carved me.  My hands were
at my sides, I suppose -- I didn't think of them until later, until after my
face.""
S1517: "Telling her your life story could take all night.  Better to stick with
some particular aspect -- your job, your family, your childhood...
"
S1518: ""What do you know about life?" you ask her.  "
S1519: "(General questions: you can almost always find ones that haven't been
anticipated.)"
S1520: "

"Nothing," she says, "except what I saw of his; and that seldom made any sense
to me.  He told me that people are born, and that they die, and that there are
stages in between-- childhood, adolescence...  I asked him why he didn't carve
me as a child so that I could grow up."  "
S1521: "Her mouth tightens a little; the memory, it seems, is not a pleasant
one.  "
S1522: ""I never heard him laugh so hard as when I asked him that.  And he said
that I certainly had the brain of a child."

"
S1523: ""What do you think personality comes from?" you ask.  "
S1524: ""If you started out as a block of stone and were animated, what is it
that makes you who you are, and not some other person?""
S1525: "

"Memories," she says, "and stories, I suppose.  The things that he told me --
in a sense I suppose he partly gave me his personality, and in the places where
he didn't tell me everything, there are gaps...  Certainly there are days when
I feel more like him than like myself.""
S1526: "You've pretty much shared such pearls of wisdom as you possess, on that
particular point.
"
S1527: ""At the risk of seeming to condescend," you remark, "I think perhaps
everyone feels that way from time to time.  Especially in adolescence, it seems
as though you're entirely alone -- you've just figured out that you're not just
an extension of your parents or whoever raised you.  But that leaves you with a
sense of isolation.  It's something you have to go through and grow out of, and
you never had the opportunity to do it naturally.""
S1528: "She takes a deep breath and nods, seeming to absorb this."
S1529: ""Was there something else you wanted to say about your perceptions of
life?" you ask.  "I get the feeling I perhaps cut you off, which I didn't mean
to do."

"No, no, that's all right."  She frowns at some spot beyond your shoulder,
apparently thinking fixedly."
S1530: ""So how do you see life that you think is so different?" you ask.

She pauses, as though she had expected a different question, or as though she
had something else that she had been going to add.  But she gives the question
fair consideration nonetheless.  "I don't know," she says finally.  "That's
just it.  I don't know what normal is, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do
or supposed to want.  I just go around doing what I'm told to do.""
S1531: "  "The strange thing is that I have no idea how other people view
life," she says, getting into a reflective mode.  "I have the feeling that my
perceptions of it are completely different and strange because of my
background; I don't know where the commonalities lie.  So I don't even know
where to start, talking to other people -- is any of this making any sense?"

You nod, wondering where this is all going."
S1532: "Your patient silence seems to act as a kind of catalyst: when Galatea
realizes that you aren't going to interrupt, she talks and talks -- about her
trip over from Cyprus, about what it's like to live here and be in the gallery,
about things she's seen and wondered about.  Her ignorance is encyclopedic, she
has a child's curiosity, but she is as logical and articulate as most adults.

"
S1533: "By the end of the evening, you're sitting beside her on the pedestal,
and you've started a list of things that she needs to see, books she ought to
read...  Educating her is going to be a long but highly amusing project, you
can see that."
S1534: ""Which really isn't that satisfactory," she concludes, when she sees
that you aren't going to interrupt.  "But I don't know what else to do.  I've
only observed one person's life -- his -- and I know that's not what I want,
even if I had the talent to do what he did."  She frowns.  "If it isn't
complimenting myself to say that he was a good sculptor..."

"Not at all," you say.  "Clearly a statement of objective fact."

"Well.  Anyway -- I guess I don't know what else there is to do.  Like I said."

"
S1535: ""That's natural and not impossible to fix," you reply.  "Granted, some
people go through life apparently never figuring out what they're interested in
or where their talents lie, but most of us find a place -- either by looking
for it or by falling into it.  You just need time to look around, and some
other friends."

"I suppose," she says dubiously, stopping again to think."
S1536: "According to her, the artist used to tell her things about the gods,
but also stories about his travels.  And some maxims, whatever that might
mean."
S1537: "It's not clear what you have in mind."
S1538: ""What stories were these that had such a great impact on you?"

"
S1539: ""What kinds of things did he tell you by way of instruction?"

"
S1540: ""There were his stories about the gods, of course," "
S1541: ""Which were I believe intended to teach me about how people think and
what forces control them.  And then there were his personal memories -- things
about his travels, for instance -- and a large selection of maxims, some of
which I'm not sure he meant seriously.""
S1542: "It sounds as though he had a collection of trite proverbs and standard
sayings that he spewed on occasion.  The subject doesn't hold your interest
sufficiently for you to remember much detail."
S1543: "It's not clear what you have in mind."
S1544: ""Do you remember any of Pygmalion's sayings in particular?""
S1545: "

She pauses for a moment.  "He had some choice things to say about the Turkish,"
she says, "but I suppose that those don't count.  I guess -- things like,
'Morning is the wisest advisor,' and 'A man must be either ignorant or brave.' 
Some I didn't understand.  Some I still don't understand.""
S1546: "Childhood is a lost and private era since your sister died; you think
of it seldom, and not ever deliberately.  So it takes you a moment to begin.

You keep it general at first, biographical facts anyone could know.  Where you
were born, and when, and in what kind of economic background.  Where you went
to school."
S1547: "It's clear that you have her full attention.  "
S1548: "She listens intently, expressing no reaction -- no judgement, no
amusement, no boredom or distraction -- and you find yourself straying into
more personal territory.  Not dark secrets, but incidents that have no bearing
on anyone but you.  "
S1549: "Your father coming home with a huge wheel of cheddar wrapped in black
wax and cutting it up with a butcher knife -- the very first visual image in
your memory."
S1550: "The time that the fires raged so strong in the foothills, and the wind
blew so hard, that the horizon was red for three days; and you came home from
school to find the ground covered with white ash, and whole leaves that had
kept their shape for all those miles only to crumble at a touch."
S1551: "Standing on the porch of a friend's house while the Santa Anna winds
stripped branches off the palm trees and made the telephone poles bend and
sway, restless with the electricity in the air."
S1552: "  The sort of thing that would make little impression now, but which at
the time seemed wonderful and strange."
S1553: ""Are you really sorry," you ask, "that you were never in a child's
body?  It's not always pleasant, being weaker and smaller, and having people
treat you as though you're less; romantic illusions of childhood aside, it's
not something I'd choose to go back to."

"
S1554: ""That may be, but it's another way in which I'll never be like other
people, or understand them."  "
S1555: "(She says 'other people' quite naturally.)"
S1556: "The sorrow in her voice is for once free of bitterness, and you find
that you much prefer the effect."
S1557: "

She continues only with effort.  "Where everyone else has common history, I
have things that only I understand; and that I could only hope to explain to
him."
S1558: "  And he isn't here to listen, nor will he ever be again."

"
S1559: "(Would he have listened in any case?  What kind of confidant could the
artist be to his piece?  In your experience -- and you should know -- artists
are oblivious to what their own work has to say.)"
S1560: "You say nothing, but a niggling doubt asserts itself; other things have
seemed false to you, but this rings true.  What is she, after all?"
S1561: ""What do you know about childhood?"

"Very little," she replies, "which is natural, considering that I didn't have
one.""
S1562: ""I would have liked to be a child," she says; "though perhaps it would
only have made things worse.  I don't think he wanted someone to look after. 
He was -- he had too many things of his own that needed to be attended to. 
Although what has become of that now?""
S1563: ""I would have liked to be a child, I think," she remarks after a
moment.  "It would have been simpler.  He would have understood when I didn't
know things, and perhaps he would have realized that I couldn't be
abandoned...""
S1564: "your"
S1565: "Your sister has been dead a long time now, but your mind still shies
from the subject."
S1566: ""My sister was two years older than I," you begin.  "And our parents
died when we were fairly young, so it was just the two of us after that; we
lived with some relatives, kind of moving around.  But she was the only one who
knew everything about me, everything that happened when I was younger.  "
S1567: "So you see I know what you mean about being abandoned by the person you
talk to most, and who understands you best."
S1568: "When she died, it was as though I'd lost access to part of myself.""
S1569: "Remembering, on purpose, is not something you've forced yourself to do
for a long time.  And it is perhaps not a good idea, even now.  Worries, first
symptoms, diagnosis, despair.  Standing in the hospital parking lot in the
whirling snow, watching the lights go out on her floor.  The hours and hours
consumed by intractable emotions.

"
S1570: "And then when she was gone, the utter solitude in your life.

"
S1571: ""Are you all right?"  Galatea is reaching towards you, but you turn
away."
S1572: "It's not a topic that you enter into lightly or with strangers.
"
S1573: ""It took three months from the time we first found out to the day she
died.  She hadn't been having regular medical checkups, we didn't even know she
was sick until suddenly she felt dreadful.""
S1574: "your"
S1575: ""My parents died when I was fairly young," you say.  "So I don't
remember them well.  Mostly just images.  My mother played the violin, and I
remember her getting ready to go play for a Scottish dance group.  She was all
dressed up and about to go, but she stopped to play one tune for me and my
sister before she left."

"
S1576: ""We didn't see her again," you explain, though something tells you
she's already guessed as much."
S1577: "your"
S1578: ""I lived with a bunch of different relatives, growing up: my aunt for a
while, and then my grandmother for a long time, but with visits to our uncle in
the summers.  It was crazy.""
S1579: ""Yes, actually, I did.  It sounds inhuman to say so, but there were
actually times when I was glad that my parents had died, because it meant I was
free.  I didn't belong to any one place.  I could go where I wanted."  Utterly
against what a child psychologist would predict, and not the kind of admission
you ordinarily make..."
S1580: "

You stop, a little flustered.  But she listens without prejudice -- perhaps
because she's too inexperienced to find this kind of thing trite, or perhaps
because what she really understands is how to be still and listen."
S1581: "As you talk, she sinks to sit on the pedestal, her skirts billowing
around her.  She only says enough to let you know that she's still listening. 
You find yourself pouring out all your losses, disappointments, frustrations. 
And last and deepest, that sense of isolation that has never left you since
Jenny died.

"
S1582: "By the end of the evening you feel as though you've been through a
wringer, and at the same time strangely healed.  "
S1583: "(Someone should write a psychologist program for animates.  It would
make millions.)  "
S1584: "

She accepts your thanks with a pale smile, watches you go, says nothing at
all."
S1585: ""What about Poseidon?"

"Uck.  He didn't care much for Poseidon -- too much bluster.  All raw power and
no thought.""
S1586: ""I never met any of them.  He just referred to them in passing from
time to time, and when I could move and went out into the garden I could see
them sometimes passing on the road below, or taking out their boats.""
S1587: ""He used to threaten me with that when I first woke up.  'If you're not
careful I'll take you to church to be exorcised.'  I didn't know what it meant
originally -- only that he hated church, and that it was a threat.""
S1588: ""So he slept in the studio?"

"Yes, he had a bed that sat on the floor.""
S1589: ""The birthplace of real civilization.  Also, a polluted sinkhole.  Take
your pick.""
S1590: ""Athens' other half.  Sometimes enemy, sometimes ally, always alien.""
S1591: ""A fine idea gone horribly wrong, is what he always said.  Though I'm
not certain just what he meant by that.""
S1592: ""If you really want to know, get yourself a guide to Rome.  I hear such
things exist.""
S1593: ""It's a city on the coast of Greece, not too distant from Epidaurus.""
S1594: ""Home of the sanctuary of Asclepius the healer, and a very famous
theater.""
S1595: ""Apuleius," she remarks.  "The whole story is in _The Golden Ass._ 
Trust me when I say that it's too long to be worth recounting.""
S1596: ""Read the Bacchae.  That's where he got the story in the first place,
so you'd probably find it more interesting than having me summarize.""
S1597: ""I don't really know much about him.  But I assume it's general
knowledge that I'm missing.""
S1598: ""The pirates who kidnapped Dionysus?  He drove them mad by making vines
grow up over the mast and the sails, and in a panic they dove into the sea and
were turned into dolphins.""
S1599: ""The only pirates I know of are the ones who kidnapped Dionysus, not
realizing that he was a god.""
S1600: ""Surely you know Homer."  As though she thinks that a person reads
Greek epic at his mother's knee."
S1601: ""Play by Euripides," she says offhandedly; and you wonder how Pygmalion
found time to carve if he was all the time reading to her from the classics."
S1602: ""He was one of the great old prophets, who appears in several different
stories.  Oedipus had a run-in with him while he was still living.""
S1603: ""You know.  The one who stabbed his eyes out because he discovered that
despite his best efforts to the contrary he'd killed his father and married his
mother.  Never assume you're smarter than an oracle.""
S1604: ""Please don't tell me you're one of those who think of him merely as a
storyteller.  He didn't make that stuff up, you know.""
S1605: ""He had nothing but contempt for them.  I don't see what was so awful
-- but he refused to tell me any of the stories.""
S1606: ""That's a subject he avoided quite thoroughly.""
S1607: ""I only know a little bit about Greek theater.  Not enough to interest
you -- you'd be better off reading a book.""
S1608: ""Hera is the goddess of matrimony and the home, Zeus' wife -- and
sister -- and an incredibly jealous woman.  And that's all I know on the
topic.""
S1609: ""There was a lot of sunlight in the studio.  He carved me during the
summer, for one thing -- though I didn't know that at the time.""
S1610: ""I only know a few vegetables by sight, and none by name, I'm afraid. 
Which probably has to do with not having to eat.""
S1611: ""I don't know much about flowers, wild or tame; by the time I was fully
awake, most of them had faded from the garden.""
S1612: ""He kept it to scare people with.  It wasn't for real use.""
S1613: ""The meter used by, for example, Homer.""
S1614: ""Who is Artemis?"

"The virgin huntress, the goddess of the moon, the mistress of wild beasts. 
Her arrows bring sudden death to women, as Apollo's to men; she is Apollo's
sister, the daughter of Zeus.""
S1615: ""The instrument that accompanies lyric poetry."  "
S1616: "She slants you a sideways, ironical look.  Don't you feel stupid?"
S1617: ""Artemis hunted with a bow and arrows.  Not the crude modern way." 
(This sounds to you very much like another of Pygmalion's sententiae.  How
would she know about 'modern methods'?)"
S1618: ""My sense of touch is fairly complete, as I understand the details --
heat and cold, pressure and pain, texture...  everything I've heard anyone
describe, at least.""
S1619: ""I've never tried it.  But he always said that cheese is addicting. 
Bad for you, okay.  But one of the single greatest inventions of man.""
S1620: ""It helps keep me from sweltering TOO badly in this spotlight, at
least.""
S1621: ""The Pythia?  She was a peasant woman, illiterate, over fifty years old
-- someone chosen because she had no family of note, no political ties, no
ability to receive messages or participate in intrigue.""
S1622: ""I am largely ignorant of them and their practices.  They come into his
stories only obliquely.""
S1623: "You have the feeling from the brevity of her earlier answer that she's
not interested in pursuing it further."
S1624: "You've pretty much exhausted that topic."
S1625: "You might ask -- if you could think of any pertinent questions."
S1626: "You straighten your jacket.  "
S1627: "You pick a bit of lint from your clothes.  "
S1628: "You straighten your jacket -- an instinctive habit, when you're
uncomfortable.  "
S1629: "You run your fingers through your hair.  "
S1630: "Half-consciously you smooth down your clothes.  "
S1631: "Your eye picks out scratches in the finish of the floor.  "
S1632: "You brush away the thought of people you should be talking to."
S1633: "You become aware, for half a second, of the people waiting for you in
the other room.  But the thought is easily squashed.  "
S1634: "You close your eyes a moment.  Long evening.  "
S1635: "You suddenly realize how tired you are; but you brush aside the thought
of a quick nightcap and a warm bed."
S1636: "You take a deep breath.  "
S1637: "(It's chilly in here; you hadn't really noticed earlier.)  "
S1638: "The air stirs, cool on your cheek.  "
S1639: "Even in the name of investigation, you'd be embarrassed to show
yourself to be that self-centered."
S1640: ""Anything else to say about me?" you demand.

"
S1641: ""'Vanity,' saith the preacher," she murmurs.  And you have the feeling
that that's all the response you're going to get."
S1642: ""What do you think of me, then?"

"
S1643: ""You seem like everyone else I meet: incomprehensible.  But then,
there's only one person I've ever begun to understand.""
S1644: ""I suppose that you seem better than you might be.  Though I have few
enough points of comparison -- how could I say whether you're any good or
not?""
S1645: "She shakes her head.  "I don't know what I think.  I'm inclined to like
you, I suppose -- but that's not terribly meaningful.""
S1646: "Her reply, when it comes, is dry and granular.  "I have few opinions of
mortals.""
S1647: ""What do you know about me?" you ask.  (They told her you were coming;
does that mean you, or some abstract viewer?  Are you really the first, this
evening, to have rounded this particular corner?)

"Nothing," she says, "other than that you have come to look at me.""
S1648: "Where do you want to start?  Your childhood, your family, your job?"
S1649: "Credit goes to Graham Nelson for Inform and to Adam Cadre for flags.h.

S1650: "This is an exercise in NPC interactivity.  There's no puzzle and no set
solution, but a number of options with a number of different outcomes.

HINTS: Ask or tell her about things that you can see, that she mentions, or
that you think of yourself.  Interact with her physically.  Pause to see if she
does anything herself.  Repeat actions.  The order in which you do things is
critical: the character's mood and the prior state of the conversation will
determine how she reacts.

VERBS: Many standard verbs have been disabled.  All the sensory ones (LOOK,
LISTEN, SMELL, TOUCH, TASTE) remain, as do the NPC interaction verbs ASK, TELL,
HELLO, GOODBYE, and SORRY; KISS, HUG, and ATTACK.  You may also find useful
THINK and its companion THINK ABOUT, which will remind you of the state of
conversation on a given topic.  The verb RECAP gives a summary list of topics
that you've discussed so far; if she's told you that she's said all she knows
on that topic, it appears in italics.

SHORTCUT: 'Ask her about' and 'tell her about' may be abbreviated to A and T. 
So >A CHEESE is the same as >ASK GALATEA ABOUT CHEESE.

There is an assortment of walkthroughs available at
http://emshort.home.mindspring.com/cheats.htm, but I suggest not looking at
them until you have already experimented somewhat.

S1651: "That's not something you can turn."
S1652: "You look behind you, but there's no one there."
S1653: "There's not really much to recap so far."
S1654: "Nothing happens.  Did you really expect it to?"
S1655: "You speak the old reset code; she freezes, face and body motionless,
and there's almost a palpable chill in the air as her internal motors turn off
and she stops generating heat.

"List Scenarios?" she asks in a frosty voice.

YES OR NO?>  "
S1656: "
"Yes," you reply; and she lists them: 

First, that she kills herself.
"
S1657: "Third, that she departs, seeking her artist.
"
S1658: "Fourth, that she departs, seeking other exhibits.
"
S1659: "Fifth, that you end as friends and confidants.
"
S1660: "Seventh, that you take her place on the pedestal.
"
S1661: "Eighth, that you offer her a home with yourself.
"
S1662: "

But whatever the ninth and further scenarios might be, it seems you are doomed
not to hear of them: her vocal program stutters, and after a moment or two of
waiting, you depart disappointed."
S1663: "
"No," you say, and turn away, down the echoing hall, as she begins the process
of resetting herself for the next visitor, forgetting all you said and did."
S1664: "You feel your mouth form the beginning of the word...

"
S1665: "...and there's that funny feeling of disconnect as you break the fourth
wall, force information into your avatar that isn't part of the program, that
comes from outside.  For just a moment the avatar circuits register doubt,
confusion, a hint of self-awareness...  

And then you're sitting back in the control room, scrubbing at your eyes with
the palm of your hand.  Someone holds a cup of water under your nose.

"You didn't finish the scenario," says a voice, up and to the left."
S1666: "

A cool reassuring hand on the back of your neck, another voice answering:
"Leave her alone for a minute!  God!"

You don't answer either of them.  Your gaze is fixed on the monitors: in the
test room your avatar has fallen slack, no longer receiving your commands.  You
sip at the water, trying to feel like yourself again.

"
S1667: ""I don't know," you say finally.  "I don't think it's going to sell. 
Too cerebral.""
S1668: "

You come around a corner, away from the noise of the opening.

There is only one exhibit.  She stands in the spotlight, with her back to you:
a sweep of pale hair on paler skin, a column of emerald silk that ends in a
pool at her feet.  She might be the model in a perfume ad; the trophy wife at a
formal gathering; one of the guests at this very opening, standing on an empty
pedestal in some ironic act of artistic deconstruction --

You hesitate, about to turn away.  Her hand balls into a fist.

"They told me you were coming."
